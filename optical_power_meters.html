<p>An optical power meter (or <em>laser powermeter</em>) is an instrument for the measurement of the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> (the delivered energy per unit time) in a light beam, for example a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>.
Typically, it allows for power measurements only with a relatively low <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, and will e.g. display only the average power when receiving a <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a> train with a high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a>, e.g. from a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched</a> or <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a>.
For measuring <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a>, there are other instruments, called <a href="optical_energy_meters.html" title="instruments for measuring optical pulse energies">optical energy meters</a>.</p>
<p>Most power meters are suitable only for light beams with a quite limited <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a>, not e.g. for diffuse light, but there are e.g. special sensor heads with an <a href="integrating_spheres.html" title="devices with a diffusely reflecting inner surface, used for certain optical measurements">integrating sphere</a>, which can accept and precisely measure even highly divergent input beams, for example from <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light emitting diodes</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Normally, an optical power meter comes with a <em>sensor head</em> (see Figure&nbsp;1) containing the power sensor, which is typically mounted with a post for receiving a horizontal input light beam in a certain height above the <a href="optical_tables.html" title="platforms for building optical devices with suppression of vibrations">optical table</a>.
A sensor head may be equipped with additional <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam">optical attenuators</a> for extending the measurement range; these are particularly offered for photodiode-based devices.</p>
<p>The sensor head may be connected to a stand-alone <em>display instrument</em>, containing an analog or digital display for the laser power.
Frequently, it allows the user to choose between different power ranges, and possibly to do other settings, for example concerning the speed of response (slow or fast mode) or the laser <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>.
Devices for telecom applications may also display powers in <a href="dbm.html" title="dB relative to a reference power of 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mW">dBm</a>, meaning <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a> relative to 1&nbsp;mW.
Some instruments have an analog electrical output, delivering a voltage signal which is proportional to the received light power, and/or a digital interface (e.g. USB, GPIB, RS-232, WLAN or Bluetooth) for connection to a computer.</p>
<p>Display instruments can often be combined with different sensor heads &ndash; even with sensor heads of different type, e.g. pyroelectric and photodiode-based types.
Some instruments can also work as <a href="optical_energy_meters.html" title="instruments for measuring optical pulse energies">optical energy meters</a>.</p>
<p>There are also <em>&ldquo;meterless&rdquo; sensor heads</em>, which can be directly connected to a computer, typically with a USB interface.
They contain only little electronics, in particular an analog-to-digital converter in addition to the digital interface, and those electronics may be integrated either into the sensor head itself or into a compact device at the USB connector or somewhere along the cable.
One uses a software coming with the device for displaying values, changing measurement ranges, possibly also for data logging and similar purposes, going beyond the functionality of a typical stand-alone power meter.
Such devices save the cost for an extra display and may also be quite convenient, for example for an engineer traveling with a notebook and only a minimum of extra instruments to carry.
Also, such power sensors may be connected to more complex systems, for example to <a href="laser_marking.html" title="a group of methods for labeling materials with lasers">laser marking</a> machines.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Sensor Types</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Thermal Sensors</h3>
<div>
<p>Most power meters are based on the principle of a <a href="thermal_detectors.html" title="light detectors which are based on measuring light-induced temperature rises">thermal detector</a>: <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> is converted to heating power in some absorber structure with a <a href="black_coatings.html" title="coatings with strong light absorption">black coating</a>, and the resulting temperature rise (or actually the temperature difference between the absorber and the mount) is measured, e.g. with a thermopile.
Such a thermal power meter (see Figure&nbsp;1) is useful for average powers between &asymp;&thinsp;0.01&nbsp;W and several kilowatts (but note that a single sensor head cannot span that whole range).
Typically, some cooling with a fan or even with water is required for powers above roughly 10&nbsp;W.</p>
<p>Thermal power meters are fairly robust (although too tight focusing onto the absorber should be avoided), moderately precise, usable in a wide <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> range (with fairly wavelength-independent sensitivity), and relatively slow.</p>
<p>When a thermal power meter is set for high sensitivity (<a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a>), for example for a maximum power below 100&nbsp;mW, its mount should not be touched with the hand during measurements.
This is because any warming of the mount can induce temperature differences which modify the reading.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Photodiodes</h3>
<div>
<p>Far more sensitive and also faster power meters can be made with <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a>, most often based on silicon (Si), but for the near infrared also on germanium (Ge).
Indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) is less common for power meters, since large area InGaAs detectors are expensive.
Powers in the microwatt region or possibly even lower can be measured.
These instruments can also be used for measuring high powers when a suitable <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam">attenuator</a> is used.
They are, however, less robust than thermal power meters: they are more easily damaged when exposed to too high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the high sensitivity of photodiodes, they are also quite suitable for sensor heads with an <a href="integrating_spheres.html" title="devices with a diffusely reflecting inner surface, used for certain optical measurements">integrating sphere</a>.
In that case, one may also use an InGaAs photodiode, because a large input area can then be achieved despite a small area photodiode.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">For single-wavelength applications, photodiode-based power meters are fine; for broadband light they may be unsuitable.</aside>
<p>Also, the sensitivity of a photodiode is rather wavelength-dependent, so that a photodiode-based power meter usually requires the user to make a setting for the wavelength.
The device then uses an internal calibration table to compensate for the wavelength-dependent <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a>.
One should of course not forget to adjust that setting when using the power meter for a laser operating at a different wavelength, because otherwise the power calibration will be wrong.
Obviously, this method does not work for beams with a very broadband or variable <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>, whereas it may be perfectly suitable in situations where the laser wavelength is rarely changed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Specifications for Power Meters</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Spectral Response</h3>
<div>
<p>The manufacturer normally specifies a certain range of optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> for which the quoted measurement accuracy is achieved.
For thermal power meters, that range can be rather broad, e.g. extending far into the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region, because it is not too difficult to make a broadband <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorber</a>, e.g. with a <a href="black_coatings.html" title="coatings with strong light absorption">black coating</a>.
Note that the quoted spectral range may be smaller than the <a href="spectral_response_of_a_photodetector.html" title="the range of optical wavelengths for which a photodetector is sensitive">spectral response</a>; there may be wavelength regions where the detector reacts, but not with a calibrated response.</p>
<p>Photodiode-based instruments may also work in a wide wavelength range, e.g. with a Si-based diode from the near ultraviolet to somewhat beyond 1&nbsp;&mu;m, but with the <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> varying substantially in such a range.
Therefore, as explained above, the user will have to set the wavelength, and the instrument will usually have to &ldquo;believe&rdquo; that this setting is correctly done.
In principle, such a power meter may be equipped with a wavelength sensor, but this is not common.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Power Measurement Ranges</h3>
<div>
<p>Most power meters allow the user to switch between different power measurement ranges &ndash; for example, with maximum powers of 0.1&nbsp;W, 0.3&nbsp;W, 1&nbsp;W and 3&nbsp;W.
With an analog display, accurate readings are possible only when choosing an appropriate measurement range.
Even for digital displays, one should choose an appropriate range, since the accuracy may suffer when measuring in a too high range.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Avoid too strongly focused input beams!</aside>
<p>The maximum allowed power for a particular sensor head is mostly limited by damage issues.
Note, however, that one can easily damage a sensor head with optical powers well below the maximum allowed power, when delivering the input beam with an inappropriately small beam diameter.
The local intensity then becomes too high, which is particularly an issue for photodiode-based devices.
(Even well before damage occurs, there may be local saturation effects, leading to wrong readings.)
Instrument specifications therefore often include a maximum allowed input intensity.
For operation with laser <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a> (particularly from <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>), there may be an additional specification for the maximum allowed pulse <a href="fluence.html" title="optical energy per unit area">fluence</a> (in J/cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>The minimum measurement range is limited by measurement noise &ndash; typically by noise coming from the sensor head.
That noise may be somewhat reduced by low-pass filtering, when a slower response is acceptable for the application.
The lowest range will usually be chosen such that the measurement uncertainty still stays at least 10 to 20&nbsp;dB below the maximum power.</p>
<p>Photodiode-based power sensors are far more sensitive than thermal ones.
Here, the lowest measurement ranges are often in the microwatt region or possibly even lower.
For the sensitive measurement ranges, one will of course have to carefully avoid influences of ambient light, e.g. by using proper shields (e.g. black anodized tubes around the beam path) and/or by working in a dark laboratory.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Accuracy</h3>
<div>
<p>Typical measurement accuracies are of the order of &pm;3&#37; or &pm;5&#37; for powers near the maximum reading in a certain measurement range.
Powers well below the maximum in some range may be less accurately measured.</p>
<p>Substantially better accuracies would require regular re-calibration and are anyway limited by detector uniformity (see below), thermal drifts and other influences.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Speed</h3>
<div>
<p>Thermal power sensors are intrinsically relatively slow &ndash; particularly those for high powers, where the thermal capacity of the sensor is tentatively higher.
Typical response times are of the order of 0.2&nbsp;s to 2&nbsp;s.
Even photodiode-based power meters are normally not made very fast, since one could anyway not read a display which is updated e.g. 10 times per second.
For power measurements with a higher measurement <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, other types of instruments (certain <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a>) must be used.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Active Area and Uniformity of Response</h3>
<div>
<p>Typical active areas of power meters are circular or square-shaped with dimensions between 5&nbsp;mm and a few centimeters.
Larger active areas are typically offered by higher-power devices.</p>
<p>A possible problem with both thermal and photodiode-based optical power meters is the uniformity of response.
For thermal power meters, a lack of uniformity can result from a dependence of the resulting <a href="absorbance.html" title="the logarithm with base 10 of the inverse transmittance">absorbance</a> or temperature distribution for different beam positions.
For <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a>, a nonuniform response can easily result from <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage</a> with too high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a>.</p>
<p>Sensor heads with an <a href="integrating_spheres.html" title="devices with a diffusely reflecting inner surface, used for certain optical measurements">integrating sphere</a> naturally provide the highest detector uniformity.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Electronic Outputs</h3>
<div>
<p>Some instruments have an analog output (e.g. through a BNC socket), where the output voltage is usually proportional to the output power relative to the maximum power in a certain measurement range.</p>
<p>Digital interfaces are very versatile, allowing for substantially expanded functionality on a computer.
For example, although data logging may be provided even by stand-alone devices, it can be more convenient to process and store such data on a computer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Dimensions</h3>
<div>
<p>The mechanical dimensions of an optical power sensor can be quite relevant for applications, e.g. when a sensor needs to be temporarily inserted into some beam path, where there is little available space.
There are some very flat hand-held sensors, mostly based on photodiodes, which require quite little space.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Power Supply</h3>
<div>
<p>Power meters require some electrical power, which may either be provided with an external power supply or with batteries (which are normally rechargeable).
Battery-powered operation is of course convenient by eliminating another cable enter the requirement of a nearby power socket, but on the other hand the need for regular recharging can also be inconvenient.
Devices connected to a computer e.g. via USB cable can get the power from there.</p>

<div>
<aside class="callout blue">For permanent monitoring in fiber-optic telecom systems, there are special power monitors.</aside>
<p>Optical power meters are mostly used for temporary purposes, e.g. when testing laboratory setups or doing maintenance operations.
For permanent monitoring of powers, mostly in the context of <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, one often uses <a href="optical_power_monitors.html" title="devices for monitoring optical powers in free-space light beams or in optical fibers">optical power monitors</a>, which can be integrated into systems.
Such power monitors are also available in fiber-coupled form, where the light from the source under test is supplied via a <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber cable</a> and a <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber-optic connector</a>.
There are also devices which can be set to register only light with certain <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a>, e.g. for measuring powers of specific <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain">WDM</a> transmission channels.</p>

<h2>Promote Your White Papers and Videos</h2>
<p>White papers and videos are great instruments for creating an interest in your technology and demonstrating the capabilities of a company. But <b>how to publicize them</b>, reaching the right audience?</p>
<p><img class="whitepaper" style="padding:30px 5px; width:70%; height:70%;" src="./img/white_paper_example.png" alt="example for white paper"></p>
<p>Our suggestion: <a href="./marketing_promotions.html?banner=white_papers">place a preview in a suitable encyclopedia article!</a>
For example, the paper preview shown above would well fit into our articles on <a href="./laser_diodes.html?banner=white_papers">laser diodes</a> and <a href="./diode_bars.html?banner=white_papers">diode bars</a>.</p>

<h2>Numerical Modeling</h2>
<p>Developing devices or systems in photonics requires a <b>comprehensive quantitative understanding</b> &ndash; otherwise, it becomes inefficient, waisting time and money.</p>
<p><a href="./laser_modeling.html?banner=numerical_modeling">Numerical modeling</a> is often the most efficient way towards results:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand <em>quantitatively</em> what is going on</li>
<li>check the influence of design changes or possible detrimental effects</li>
<li>understand strange experimental observations</li>
<li>find optimized designs more reliably and faster</li>
