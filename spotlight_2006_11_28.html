<p>Abstract: This article shows that it is very instructive to consider in some detail the role of diffraction in laser resonators. This leads to a better understanding of how resonators work, and also of important insight into resonator design issues. Such insight is essential for optimized resonator designs, used as essential parts of laser designs.</p>

<p>We all know the phenomenon of <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> from experiments where light is diffracted at some small aperture.
However, diffraction also occurs during free-space propagation of a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>, particularly where the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> is small.
Diffraction modifies the curvature of the wavefronts and subsequently the beam size.
Also, it is related to the <a href="gouy_phase_shift.html" title="an additional phase shift occurring in the propagation of focused Gaussian beams">Gouy phase shift</a>.</p>
<p>It is very instructive to consider the role of diffraction within optical resonators, in particular in <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonators</a>.
As a simple example, consider a linear resonator consisting of a flat and a concave (focusing) <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirror</a>.
In each resonator round trip, the concave mirror has a focusing effect, while diffraction acts in the opposite direction.
For a <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a> with a focus on the flat mirror and a suitable <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a>, the focusing effect of the concave mirror is exactly offset by the effect of diffraction during propagation; the corresponding light field is called the fundamental <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">mode</a> of the resonator.
Such modes exist for a wide range of mirror curvatures (within some stability zone), because the strength of the defocusing effect of diffraction can be adjusted via changes in the beam radius.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, diffraction in a laser resonator becomes strong when the <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a>, evaluated for the smallest occurring <a href="beam_waist.html" title="location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a>, becomes shorter than the resonator length.
If the Rayleigh length becomes really short, focusing optical elements within the resonator are normally required; one will often have a nearly <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated beam</a> in some part of the resonator, and a strongly focused beam in another part.</p>
<p>By a sort of coincidence, typical <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> require <a href="beam_waist.html" title="location with minimum beam radius">beam waists</a> with a size such that the Rayleigh length is of the order of the resonator length, or somewhat below.
This leads to well working resonator designs with a substantial, but not extreme variation of beam radius.
However, some <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high power lasers</a>, particularly <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched</a> ones, require very large mode sizes in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> and on all cavity mirrors, while keeping the resonator short, so that diffraction effects can be very weak.
&ldquo;So what,&rdquo; the beginner may say, &ldquo;isn't it nice to have a nearly constant beam radius throughout the resonator?&rdquo;
Unfortunately, it isn't:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, any change of focusing conditions, e.g. via power-dependent <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, now leads to strong changes in the mode radius, because only those can sufficiently modify the weak diffraction effect so as to compensate the change of focusing.</li>
<li>Second, the <a href="gouy_phase_shift.html" title="an additional phase shift occurring in the propagation of focused Gaussian beams">Gouy phase shift</a> becomes quite weak, and the consequence of that is that the resonances of <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes">higher-order modes</a> nearly coincide with that of the fundamental mode.
Therefore, mode coupling to higher-order mode becomes strong (nearly resonant), and the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> can easily be degraded.</li>
<li>Third, large modes become sensitive to misalignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of all of that, the laser performance and robustness can really suffer.
So we better have some substantial amount of diffraction in our resonator!</p>
<p>This discussion shows that a thorough understanding of diffraction effects and their consequences brings important insight into issues of <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a>, in particular into typical physical limitations and the principles of common solutions.
(By the way, having powerful <a href="resonator.html">resonator design software</a> is no substitute for that kind of knowledge!)
Particularly for short resonators with large modes, severe problems can result from too weak diffraction effects.
Of course, to some extent one can solve these by arranging for a tight focus somewhere insight the cavity.
The art of <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a> (as an important part of <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a>) is to find the optimum balance of all the relevant effects so as to optimize a combination of properties such as suitable mode sizes at certain positions, minimum alignment sensitivity, compactness, minimum number of components, etc.</p>
<p>It is a great mistake (and a very widespread one) to ignore all these issues and to use poorly designed resonators (sometimes literally resulting from trial and error) for laser products!</p>
