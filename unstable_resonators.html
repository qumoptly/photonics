</header>
<p>Depending on details of its design, an <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonator</a> is either stable or unstable with respect to transverse beam offsets.
If it is stable, any geometrical ray injected into the system with some not too large initial transverse offset position and angle will stay within the system during many round trips.
In an unstable resonator, such a ray will be ejected sooner or later.</p>
<p>The properties of the <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> are very different in the stable or unstable regime.
Unstable resonators have a number of special properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The modes always experience significant <em>diffraction losses</em>, which are often very high (order of 50&thinsp;&#37; per round trip or higher).</li>
<li>The diffraction losses generally become higher for higher mode orders.
This intrinsic <em>mode discrimination</em> can help one to obtain <a href="single_mode_operation.html" title="operation of a laser on axial (longitudinal) resonator modes only, or even on a single axial mode">single transverse mode operation</a> of a laser.</li>
<li>Particularly for resonators with <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> at hard edges, the transverse mode profiles are very complicated and usually exhibit pronounced ring structures.
Only numerical methods can then be used for calculating the detailed mode profiles.
For some soft-<a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">aperture</a> resonators (see below), however, the mode properties can at least be estimated with reasonable accuracy using analytical methods.</li>
<li>In a linear unstable resonator, the <a href="wavefronts.html" title="surfaces connecting points with the same phase of a wave">wavefronts</a> of the counterpropagating beams do not necessarily match each other, and they do not necessarily match the surfaces of the two end mirrors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The attribute &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; should not be misunderstood as stating that such resonators are less robust than stable ones.
To the contrary, the <a href="alignment_sensitivity_of_optical_resonators.html" title="the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">alignment sensitivity</a> of unstable laser resonators can be even substantially lower than for stable resonators, and rather robust high-power lasers have been developed with unstable resonators.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Output Coupling in Unstable Laser Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>Unstable laser resonators are usually made such that the mentioned diffraction &ldquo;losses&rdquo; are taken as the useful laser output.
The <a href="output_couplers.html" title="partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupler</a> can be an ordinary <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirror</a> where the field distribution extends beyond the mirror edges, so that some light passes the mirror on the sides (see Fig.&nbsp;1).
Although the output beam profile has a hole in the <a href="near_field_and_far_field.html" title="the optical field either close to a source or object or far from it">near field</a>, the beam divergence is quite small, and the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> for some very <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power lasers</a> with such resonators is at least higher than achievable with stable resonators &ndash; particularly if large diffraction losses can be tolerated, so that the hole can be made relatively small.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In other cases, a <em>scraper mirror</em> (Fig.&nbsp;2, e.g., a tilted mirror with an elliptical hole) is used, which &ldquo;scrapes off&rdquo; some light from the circulating intracavity beam.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/unstable_resonator_2.png" alt="unstable resonator with a scraper mirror">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another possibility is the use of a <a href="variable_reflectivity_mirrors.html" title="mirrors with a spatial variation of the reflectivity (reflectance)"><em>variable reflectivity mirror</em></a>, where the reflectivity decreases with increasing distance to the beam axis &ndash; often according to a Gaussian or super-Gaussian function.
This approach can avoid the otherwise typical ring structures in the near-field output beam profile and is often suitable for obtaining a rather high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, a resonator is stable in one direction and unstable in the other direction.
Such <em>hybrid resonators</em> are sometimes used in situations with highly elliptical beams [14].</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Advantages and Limitations of Unstable Laser Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>Although most <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonators</a> are designed as stable resonators, unstable resonators can have substantial advantages in certain cases.
In particular, they can help to generate a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> with very high <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> and still relatively high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
A frequent problem with stable resonators in such cases is that a large enough fundamental <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator mode</a> cannot be realized, or that this mode is highly sensitive to disturbances like <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> or <a href="alignment_sensitivity.html">misalignment</a>.
An unstable resonator, however, can have a very large fundamental mode with a substantial net gain advantage over all higher-order modes, and with no excessive sensitivity.
However, this principle usually works well only when the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> can provide a rather large <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>.
This can be the case in pulsed <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">flashlamp-pumped</a> or <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">YAG lasers</a>, in metal vapor lasers, <a href="excimer_lasers.html" title="lasers where optical amplification occurs in a plasma containing excited dimers (or other molecules) with an anti-binding electronic ground state">excimer lasers</a> and chemical lasers, for example.
The application to low-gain lasers such as <a href="co2_lasers.html" title="infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules">CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</a> or <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">lamp-pumped</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> is more difficult and often leads to a lower beam quality.</p>

<h2>Numerical Modeling</h2>
<p>Developing devices or systems in photonics requires a <b>comprehensive quantitative understanding</b> &ndash; otherwise, it becomes inefficient, waisting time and money.</p>
<p><a href="./laser_modeling.html?banner=numerical_modeling">Numerical modeling</a> is often the most efficient way towards results:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand <em>quantitatively</em> what is going on</li>
<li>check the influence of design changes or possible detrimental effects</li>
<li>understand strange experimental observations</li>
<li>find optimized designs more reliably and faster</li>
</ul>
