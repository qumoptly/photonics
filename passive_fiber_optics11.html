<h2 class="togglediv">Part 11: Nonlinearities of Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>In an optical fiber, light is confined to a small transverse region, so that even moderate optical powers leads to high optical intensities.
In addition, light often propagates over considerable distances in a fiber.
For these reasons, nonlinear effects due to fiber <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> often have substantial effects.
This is particularly the case if fibers are used to transmit short pulses, and in <a href="tutorial_fiber_amplifiers7.html">fiber amplifiers for short pulses</a>.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">The Kerr Nonlinearity</h3>
<div>
<p>The simplest and most common nonlinear effect in fibers is the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr effect</a>.
Essentially, this means that the phase delay in the fiber gets larger if the optical intensity increases.
This can be described via an increase of <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> in proportion to the intensity:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/spm_dn.gif" width="65" height="24" alt="index change via SPM"></div>
<p>That increase can often be considered as instantaneous, even though this is not exactly true in reality.
Below we also consider effects of non-instantaneous nonlinearities.</p>
<p>The <a href="nonlinear_index.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the Kerr nonlinearity of a medium">nonlinear index</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>n</i><sub>2</sub></span> is rather small for <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> &ndash; around 2.7&thinsp;&middot;&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;16</sup>&thinsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/W for wavelengths around 1.5&nbsp;&mu;m.
In numerical simulations, one usually uses a value according to the center <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>, i.e., tentatively higher values for shorter wavelengths.
Other glasses, e.g. <a href="fluoride_glasses.html" title="glasses made from compounds of fluorine e.g. with zirconium, aluminum or indium">fluoride glasses</a> or chalcogenide glasses, often have substantially stronger nonlinearities.</p>
<p>Note that electrostriction leads to some reduction in fiber diameter at high intensities.
That effect, however, requires some time.
For nanosecond pulses, it leads to some increase of the effective nonlinear index, which is not seen for picosecond or femtosecond pulses.
This is one of the reasons why somewhat different nonlinear index values appear in the literature.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Self-phase Modulation</h3>
<div>
<p>One of the consequences of the Kerr effect is <a href="self_phase_modulation.html" title="nonlinear phase modulation of a beam, caused by its own intensity via the Kerr effect">self-phase modulation</a> (SPM).
This means that a light wave in the fiber experiences a nonlinear phase delay which results from its own intensity.</p>
<p>For a fiber mode, the phase change per unit optical power and unit length is described by the proportionality constant</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/spm_gamma_fiber.gif" width="93" height="46" alt="SPM"></div>
<p>(in units of rad/(W &middot; m)) where <span class="eqn_il"><i>A</i><sub>eff</sub></span> is the <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a>.
Interestingly, for a nearly Gaussian mode shape with <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i></span> this value is only half the value for a <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a> in a homogeneous medium, where only the on-axis value is considered.
In the fiber, we have lower phase changes away from the fiber axis, and the overall nonlinear phase delay is only half the peak value.
(Note that the wavefronts of a mode in the fiber are kept approximately plane despite SPM; the mode is &ldquo;kept together&rdquo; by the balance of diffraction and waveguiding, and the nonlinear phase change is &ldquo;spread&rdquo; over the whole beam profile.)</p>
<p>If an optical <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a> is transmitted through a fiber, the Kerr effect causes a time-dependent phase shift according to the time-dependent pulse intensity.
In this way, an initial unchirped optical <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a> acquires a so-called <a href="chirp.html" title="time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirp</a>, i.e., a temporally varying instantaneous frequency.
This is shown in Figure&nbsp;1:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/spm.png" alt="effect of self-phase modulation on a pulse">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Instantaneous frequency of an initially unchirped pulse which has experienced self-phase modulation.
The central part of the pulse exhibits an up-chirp.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> with picosecond or femtosecond <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> and a high <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a>, the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a> can wiggle around in a range of many terahertz.
This can lead to substantial spectral broadening, i.e., increase of the spectral <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
Note, however, that the optical spectrum (Fourier spectrum) does <em>not</em> simply reflect the range of instantaneous frequencies.
Typically, it shows strong oscillations if SPM is the dominant effect and <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> effects (see <a href="passive_fiber_optics10.html">part 10</a>) are much weaker.
This is shown in Figure&nbsp;2 for an example case:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/spm_spectrum.png" alt="effect of self-phase modulation on a pulse">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Spectrum of an initially unchirped 1-ps pulse which has experienced strong self-phase modulation (with a peak nonlinear phase shift of 20&nbsp;rad), leading to characteristic oscillations of the <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As explained in our encyclopedia article on <a href="self_phase_modulation.html" title="nonlinear phase modulation of a beam, caused by its own intensity via the Kerr effect">self-phase modulation</a>, these oscillations can be understood as a kind of <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effect, related to the fact that the instantaneous frequency reaches each value at two different times.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, substantial broadening begins if the nonlinear phase shift exceeds <span class="eqn_il">2<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>.
For a standard <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a> with a mode area of 75&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>, for example, this starts for a peak power of a few kilowatts over a meter of fiber.
Note that 1&nbsp;kW peak power for a 1-ps pulse means only about 1&nbsp;nJ of <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a>; one easily reaches many kilowatts with <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> (see <a href="passive_fiber_optics10.html">part 10</a>) also often has a strong influence on ultrashort pulses.
The overall effect of Kerr nonlinearity and dispersion is therefore strongly dependent on the dispersion properties.
For example, <a href="solitons.html" title="pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects">soliton</a> pulses can be formed in a fiber with anomalous dispersion.
For a fundamental soliton, self-phase modulation and dispersion act together such that there is no temporal or spectral broadening any more.
For higher-order solitons, there is a periodic evolution, which becomes rather complicated for high orders.
In the normal dispersion regime, chromatic dispersion leads to temporal broadening, which reduces nonlinear phase shifts, and strongly <a href="chirp.html" title="time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirped pulses</a> may arise.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Nonlinear Self-focusing</h3>
<div>
<p>Another consequence of the Kerr effect is nonlinear <a href="self_focusing.html" title="focusing of a beam in a transparent medium, caused by the beam itself through a nonlinear process in the medium">self-focusing</a>.
One can recalculate the fiber modes (see <a href="passive_fiber_optics2.html">part 2</a>) such that the nonlinear self-focusing is included.
The modes then shrink significantly if the optical power reaches 1&nbsp;MW or higher.
This is illustrated in Figure&nbsp;3:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiberpower_self_focusing2.png" alt="mode area vs. optical power">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Numerically calculated mode area of a <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fiber</a> versus optical power.
The nonlinear index was assumed to be 2.2 &middot; 10<sup>&minus;20</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/W.
The red line indicates the critical power for catastrophic self-focusing.
The figure has been taken from a <a href="fiberpower_self_focusing.html">demonstration</a> of the software <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For a peak power of the order of 5&nbsp;MW (in <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>), <em>catastrophic self-focusing</em> occurs: the shrinking intensity profile further increases the nonlinear focusing effect, which in turn leads to more shrinking, and the profile collapses totally.
The enormously high intensities subsequently destroy the fiber; a single ultrashort pulse is sufficient for that.</p>
<p>Self-focusing also destabilizes higher-order modes of a multimode fiber.
Figure&nbsp;5 shows an example, where a power of 4&nbsp;MW has been injected into the LP<sub>11</sub> mode of a fiber (as calculated without the fiber nonlinearity).
After about 10&nbsp;mm of propagation distance, the light is transferred into a mixture of LP<sub>01</sub> and LP<sub>11</sub>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiberpower_self_focusing4.png" alt="numerical beam propagation with Kerr nonlinearity">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
Amplitude profile in the x-z plane for injection of the LP<sub>11</sub> mode (as calculated without the nonlinearity). The simulation has been done with the <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a> software.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(This is part of a <a href="fiberpower_self_focusing.html">case study on nonlinear self-focusing</a>.)</p>
<p>Most nonlinear effects can be reduced by using a fiber with a large <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a>, as this leads to lower optical intensities for a given power level.
However, the power threshold for critical self-focusing does <em>not</em> depend on the mode area.
This is essentially because larger modes are more sensitive to lensing effects.
As a result, the optical <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> in a fiber must always be limited to a few megawatt; self-focusing introduces a rather hard limit.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Cross-phase Modulation</h3>
<div>
<p>If two different waves, e.g. at two different wavelengths, propagate together in a fiber, there can be a nonlinear phase change of each beam resulting from the intensity of the other beam.
This phenomenon of <a href="cross_phase_modulation.html" title="a nonlinear effect where the optical intensity of one beam influences the phase change of another beam">cross-phase modulation</a> (XPM), which occurs in addition to self-phase modulation, can be relevant in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> with <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain">wavelength division multiplexing</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Curiously, the resulting phase changes are two times larger than one would expect from the equation for self-phase modulation as given above, if both beams have the same linear polarization.
For XPM, we then have a phase change of beam 2 resulting from the intensity of beam 1 according to</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/xpm_dn.gif" width="96" height="26" alt="index change via XPM"></div>
<p>while a 3 times smaller nonlinear phase change than that would result for orthogonal polarization directions.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Four-wave Mixing</h3>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:164px;">
<img src="img/fwm.png" alt="four-wave mixing">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;5:</span> 
Generation of new frequency components via four-wave mixing.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another effect resulting from the Kerr effect is <a href="four_wave_mixing.html" title="an interaction of light waves based on a &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity">four-wave mixing</a>.
For example, if two wavelength components travel together through a fiber, four-wave mixing may lead to two new frequency components (see Figure&nbsp;5).
This can be understood as follows: the two input frequencies lead to a <a href="beat_note.html" title="an oscillation of the optical intensity arising from the superposition of light with different optical frequencies">beat note</a>, i.e., an oscillation of the total intensity with a frequency which is the difference of the two optical frequencies.
Through the Kerr effect, this leads to a phase modulation, which creates sidebands.
Note, however, that this process can be effective over long lengths of fiber only if it is phase-matched.
Otherwise, the amplitudes added to the sidebands at some point in the fiber do not constructively add to those generated at other points.
Therefore, four-wave mixing often occurs only near the <a href="zero_dispersion_wavelength.html" title="a wavelength where the group delay dispersion of a fiber or a material is zero">zero dispersion wavelength</a> of a fiber.
Note that the phase matching is also influenced by the Kerr effect.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Parametric Amplification and Oscillation</h3>
<div>
<p>An effect related to four-wave mixing is <a href="optical_parametric_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on parametric nonlinear interactions">optical parametric amplification</a> and <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">oscillation</a>.
Injection of light at some wavelength into a fiber can generate a nonlinear gain at other wavelength.
That can be exploited for amplifying signals or for parametric oscillation, i.e., the generation of new wavelength components without injecting light at such wavelengths.
In contrast to parametric amplifiers and oscillators based on <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a>, parametric fiber devices have signal and idler wavelengths around the pump wavelength, instead of twice the pump wavelength.
This is because they are based on a &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity rather than a &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> nonlinearity.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Non-instantaneous Nonlinear Response</h3>
<div>
<p>We have already mentioned electrostriction as a nonlinear effect with a finite response time.
For quickly changing optical powers, this can excite lattice vibrations.
These in turn can influence the propagating light.
This leads to stimulated <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a> and <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a>, which are discussed in the following.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Brillouin Scattering</h3>
<div>
<p>Simulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is associated with acoustical phonons (in the gigahertz range).
It turns out that this interaction can normally be intrinsically <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase-matched</a> only such that it couples two counterpropagating optical waves.
Energy conservation demands that the optical frequencies differ by the acoustic frequency.
If we inject a single <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> wave into the fiber, there will be a nonlinear gain for counterpropagating waves with optical frequencies which are lower by the <em>Brillouin frequency shift</em></p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/brillouin_shift.gif" width="72" height="42" alt="Brillouin frequency shift"></div>
<p>which depends on the refractive index, the acoustic velocity and the vacuum wavelength.
For <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>, the Brillouin frequency shift is of the order of 10&ndash;20&nbsp;GHz, and the Brillouin gain occurs within a <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of typically 50&ndash;100&nbsp;MHz.
The Brillouin gain spectrum may actually be substantially broadened by transverse variations of the acoustic phase velocity or longitudinal temperature variations, for example.
Accordingly, the peak gain may be reduced.</p>
<p>One might think that one doesn't have to worry about Brillouin scattering if one doesn't inject any counterpropagating light into a fiber.
However, if the Brillouin gets quite large &ndash; to the order of 90&nbsp;dB &ndash;, it is enough to amplify <a href="vacuum_noise.html" title="quantum noise of the vacuum state, or quantum noise introduced into an optical system via a vacuum input">vacuum noise</a> (the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field) to substantial power levels.
Therefore, above a certain SBS power threshold one suddenly obtains a strong nonlinear reflection of light in the fiber, and low-loss transmission is no longer possible.
Unfortunately, that often nasty effect can kick in at rather low power levels, at least for light with a low optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
For example, for a fiber length of 10&nbsp;m it may occur for only a few watts of optical power.</p>
<p>A common method to suppress SBS is to make sure that injected light has a large optical bandwidth.
This &ldquo;smears out&rdquo; the Brillouin gain spectrum and accordingly reduces the peak gain.
For ultrashort pulses, SBS then basically disappears as a problem &ndash; but Raman scattering can still occur:</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Raman Scattering</h3>
<div>
<p>Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) is based on optical phonons, having quite high frequencies in the terahertz range.
Here, the interaction is similarly strong in forward and backward direction.
Backward scattering can be suppressed for short pulses, as these can overlap in a fiber only over a limited length.
Forward SRS, however, can act over a long length of fiber and can lead to a substantial transfer of power to a Raman-shifted wavelength component, which typically has a wavelength which is longer by some dozens of nanometers.
That effect is already substantial for a nonlinear Raman gain of 40&nbsp;dB: one requires less nonlinear gain than for Brillouin scattering, as it occurs in a much broader bandwidth (several terahertz).</p>
<p>If a pulse has a very large optical bandwidth, SRS may even act within the pulse spectrum: energy is redistributed from higher-frequency components to lower-frequency components of the pulse.
As a result, the overall pulse spectrum drifts towards longer wavelengths.</p>
