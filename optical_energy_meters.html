<p>An optical energy meter (or <em>laser energy meter</em>) is an instrument for the measurement of optical <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a>, for example for pulses from <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>.
It generally works in a wide range of <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a>, with limitations discussed below.
While some instruments can detect very faint pulses in the picojoule region, others are suitable for high pulse energies of many joules.</p>
<p>Most optical energy meters are suitable only for light beams with a quite limited <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a>, not e.g. for diffuse light, but there are e.g. special sensor heads with an <a href="integrating_spheres.html" title="devices with a diffusely reflecting inner surface, used for certain optical measurements">integrating sphere</a>, which can accept and precisely measure even highly divergent input beams.
However, most applications involve laser beams where the handling of strong divergence is not required; one may then still benefit from the high spatial uniformity of response provided by an integrating sphere.</p>
<p>For pulse trains with a constant <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a>, one can calculate the average pulse energy by dividing the average power, measured with an <a href="optical_power_meters.html" title="instruments for optical power measurements, based e.g. on heating of an absorber structure or a photodiode">optical power meter</a>, by the repetition rate.
One cannot measure pulse energy fluctuations that way, however.
An optical energy meter can separately measure the energy of each pulse and possibly also provide statistics on the measured energies of multiple pulses.</p>
<p>Normally, an optical energy meter comes with a <em>sensor head</em> containing the energy sensor, which is typically mounted with a post for receiving a horizontal input light beam in a certain height above the <a href="optical_tables.html" title="platforms for building optical devices with suppression of vibrations">optical table</a>.
A sensor head may be equipped with additional <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam">optical attenuators</a> for extending the measurement range; these are particularly offered for photodiode-based devices.</p>
<p>The sensor head may be connected to a stand-alone <em>display instrument</em>, containing an analog or digital display for the laser power.
Frequently, it allows the user to choose between different energy ranges, and possibly to do other settings, for example concerning display modes or the laser <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>.
It may also have an analog electrical output, delivering a voltage signal which is proportional to the last received pulse energy, and/or a digital interface (e.g. USB, GPIB or RS-232) for connection to a computer.</p>
<p>Display instruments can often be combined with different sensor heads &ndash; even with sensor heads of different type, e.g. pyroelectric and photodiode-based types.
Some instruments can also work as <a href="optical_power_meters.html" title="instruments for optical power measurements, based e.g. on heating of an absorber structure or a photodiode">optical power meters</a>.</p>
<p>There are also compact USB interfaces with which an energy sensor can be connected to a computer.
They contain only little electronics, in particular an analog-to-digital converter in addition to the digital interface.
One uses a software coming with the device for displaying values, changing measurement ranges, possibly also for data logging and similar purposes, going beyond the functionality of typical stand-alone energy meters.
Such devices save the cost for an extra display and may also be quite convenient, for example for an engineer traveling with a notebook and only a minimum of extra instruments to carry.
Also, such energy sensors may be connected to more complex systems.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Sensor Types</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Pyroelectric Sensors</h3>
<div>
<p>Most optical energy meters are based on the principle of a <a href="pyroelectric_detectors.html" title="light detectors based on the pyroelectric effect">pyroelectric detector</a>, which is a kind of <a href="thermal_detectors.html" title="light detectors which are based on measuring light-induced temperature rises">thermal detector</a>.
Most of the incident optical energy is <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorbed</a> e.g. by some <a href="black_coatings.html" title="coatings with strong light absorption">black coating</a>.
The heat is then conducted into a ferroelectric crystal, which produces a voltage pulse, the magnitude of which is proportional to the pulse energy.</p>
<p>Such thermal energy meters are typically usable for pulse energies between a few nanojoules and many joules &ndash; but note that a single sensor head usually cannot span that whole range.</p>
<p>Pyroelectric energy meters are reasonably precise and are usable in a wide <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> range (with fairly wavelength-independent sensitivity).
They are fairly robust, although too tight focusing onto the absorber should be avoided.
With high quality absorbers (e.g. based on ceramic materials), they can even withstand quite substantial optical peak intensities.</p>
<p>For more details, see the article on <a href="pyroelectric_detectors.html" title="light detectors based on the pyroelectric effect">pyroelectric detectors</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Photodiodes</h3>
<div>
<p>Far more sensitive energy meters can be made with <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a>, most often based on silicon (Si), but for the near infrared also with germanium (Ge).
Indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) is less common for energy meters, since large area InGaAs detectors are expensive.
Energies in the picojoule region can be measured.
Photodiodes can also be used for measuring high energies when a suitable <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam">attenuator</a> is used.
They are, however, less robust than thermal energy meters: they are more easily damaged when exposed to too high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the high sensitivity of photodiodes, they are also quite suitable for sensor heads with an <a href="integrating_spheres.html" title="devices with a diffusely reflecting inner surface, used for certain optical measurements">integrating sphere</a>.
In that case, one may also use an InGaAs photodiode, because a large input area can then be achieved despite a small area photodiode.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">For single-wavelength applications, photodiode-based power meters are fine; for broadband light they may be unsuitable.</aside>
<p>Also, the sensitivity of a photodiode is rather wavelength-dependent, so that a photodiode-based energy meter usually requires the user to make a setting for the wavelength.
The device then uses an internal calibration table to compensate for the wavelength-dependent <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a>.
One should of course not forget to adjust that setting when using the energy meter for a laser operating at a different wavelength, because otherwise the energy calibration will be wrong.
Obviously, this method does not work for beams with a very broadband or variable <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>, whereas it may be perfectly suitable in situations where the laser wavelength is rarely changed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Specifications for Optical Energy Meters</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Spectral Response</h3>
<div>
<p>The manufacturer normally specifies a certain range of optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> for which the quoted measurement accuracy is achieved.
For thermal detectors, that range can be rather broad, e.g. extending far into the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region, because it is not too difficult to make a broadband <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorber</a>, e.g. with a <a href="black_coatings.html" title="coatings with strong light absorption">black coating</a>.
Note that the quoted spectral range may be smaller than the <a href="spectral_response_of_a_photodetector.html" title="the range of optical wavelengths for which a photodetector is sensitive">spectral response</a>; there may be wavelength regions where the detector reacts, but not with a calibrated response.</p>
<p>Photodiode-based instruments may also work in a wide wavelength range, e.g. with a Si-based diode from the near ultraviolet to somewhat beyond 1&nbsp;&mu;m, but with the <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> varying substantially in such a range.
Therefore, as explained above, the user will have to set the wavelength, and the instrument will usually have to &ldquo;believe&rdquo; that this setting is correctly done.
In principle, such an energy meter may be equipped with a wavelength sensor, but this is not common.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Energy Measurement Ranges</h3>
<div>
<p>Most energy meters allow the user to switch between different measurement ranges &ndash; for example, with maximum energies of 100&nbsp;nJ, 300&nbsp;nJ, 1&nbsp;&mu;J, 3&nbsp;&mu;J and 10&nbsp;&mu;J.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Avoid too strongly focused input beams!</aside>
<p>The maximum allowed energy for a particular sensor head is mostly limited by damage issues.
Note, however, that one can easily damage a sensor head with optical energies well below the maximum allowed energy, when delivering the input beam with an inappropriately small beam diameter.
The local intensity then becomes too high, which is particularly an issue for photodiode-based devices.
(Even well before damage occurs, there may be local saturation effects, leading to wrong readings.)
Instrument specifications therefore often include a maximum allowed input <a href="fluence.html" title="optical energy per unit area">fluence</a> (in J/cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>There may be a further limitation for the allowed average power.
That means that for the highest possible pulse repetition rates, the pulse energy needs to be limited, because otherwise there would be too strong heating of the sensor.</p>
<p>The minimum measurement range is limited by measurement noise &ndash; typically by noise coming from the sensor head.
The lowest energy range will usually be chosen such that the measurement uncertainty still stays at least 10 to 20&nbsp;dB below the maximum energy.</p>
<p>Photodiode-based energy sensors are far more sensitive than thermal ones.
Here, the lowest measurement ranges are often in the picojoule region.
For the sensitive measurement ranges, one will of course have to carefully avoid influences of ambient light, e.g. by using proper shields (e.g. black anodized tubes around the beam path) and/or by working in a dark laboratory.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Accuracy</h3>
<div>
<p>Typical measurement accuracies are of the order of &pm;3&#37; or &pm;5&#37; for powers near the maximum reading in a certain measurement range.
Energies well below the maximum in some range may be less accurately measured.</p>
<p>Substantially better accuracies would require regular re-calibration and are anyway limited by detector uniformity (see below), thermal drifts and other influences.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Maximum Repetition Rate</h3>
<div>
<p>Thermal energy sensors are quite limited in terms of the maximum possible <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a>.
Particularly fast devices can be used with tens of kilohertz or even well over 100&nbsp;kHz, while others are limited to a few kilohertz or even less than 1&nbsp;kHz.
Tentatively, devices for higher energies are slower.</p>
<p>Photodiode-based energy meters can be much faster, e.g. for pulse repetition rates of hundreds of kilohertz.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Allowed Range of Pulse Durations</h3>
<div>
<p>Generally, pulse energy meters do not temporally resolve the pulses, and the displayed energies are not significantly affected by the <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a>.
However, the pulses should not be too long; there may be a limit e.g. at a couple of microseconds (very much depending on the type of device).</p>
<p>On the other hand, very short pulses may be a problem in combination with high energies, because the <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> and peak <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">intensity</a> can then be very high.
Device specifications normally do not include a minimum allowed pulse duration, since that would have to depend on the beam area and possibly on the wavelength, but in practice one might experience limitations in extreme cases, particularly when the beam diameter is made too small.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Active Area and Uniformity of Response</h3>
<div>
<p>Typical active areas of power meters are circular or square-shaped with dimensions between a few millimeters and a few centimeters.
Larger active areas are typically offered by higher-energy devices.</p>
<p>A possible problem with both thermal and photodiode-based optical energy meters is the uniformity of response.
For thermal sensors, a lack of uniformity can result from a dependence of the resulting <a href="absorbance.html" title="the logarithm with base 10 of the inverse transmittance">absorbance</a> or temperature distribution for different beam positions.
For <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a>, a nonuniform response can easily result from <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage</a> with too high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a>.</p>
<p>Sensor heads with an <a href="integrating_spheres.html" title="devices with a diffusely reflecting inner surface, used for certain optical measurements">integrating sphere</a> naturally provide the highest detector uniformity.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Electronic Outputs</h3>
<div>
<p>Some instruments have an analog output (e.g. through a BNC socket), where the output voltage is usually proportional to the energy of the last registered pulse relative to the maximum energy in a certain measurement range.</p>
<p>Digital interfaces are very versatile, allowing for substantially expanded functionality on a computer.
For example, although data logging may be provided even by stand-alone devices, it can be more convenient to process and store such data on a computer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Data Logging and Pulse Energy Statistics</h3>
<div>
<p>While a simple optical energy meter may simply display the energy of the last received pulse, more advanced devices offer substantially enhanced functionality.</p>
<p>Data logging means that all the measured pulse energies, possibly together with the time of recording, are stored in a file for later analysis.
In some cases, instead of taking all pulse energies, one can take samples of pulses with a certain lower repetition rate, so that the amount of data is correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p>A graphical digital display may work in different display modes.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may display all pulse energies versus time or pulse number, or only the data of some number of most recent pulses (e.g. the last 100).</li>
<li>One may obtain a histogram of pulse energies, possibly together with a fit for a Gaussian distribution together with its numerical parameters (e.g. average energy and r.m.s. value of energy fluctuations).</li>
<li>One may get a set of statistical values, e.g. average or median energy, minimum and maximum value, r.m.s. value of fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<p>An instrument may also display the pulse repetition rate, and it may indicate any missing pulses.</p>
<p>Some instruments allow the user to enter some threshold value for the pulse energy, and the instrument can count the number of pulses above or below that threshold.
There may also be two threshold values for checking whether the pulse energies stay in a certain allowed range.</p>
<p>A software interface for transferring the data to other software may also be very useful.
For example, an automated <a href="pump_probe_measurements.html" title="techniques for investigating ultrafast phenomena, where a pump pulse excites a sample and a probe pulse is used for probing the sample after an adjustable delay time">pump&ndash;probe measurement</a> setup may record incident and reflected pulse energies from a sample, and display the processed data.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Triggering</h3>
<div>
<p>In the simplest case, a device may record all pulses which it can detect.
One may also be able to set a threshold value, such that pulses below that threshold are ignored.
Some devices have an external trigger input; when a trigger impulse is received, the device will measure the energy of the next arriving pulse or display the last received pulse.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Dimensions</h3>
<div>
<p>The mechanical dimensions of an optical energy sensor can be quite relevant for applications, e.g. when a sensor needs to be temporarily inserted into some beam path, where there is little available space.
There are some very flat hand-held sensors, mostly based on photodiodes, which require quite little space.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Power Supply</h3>

<p>Energy meters require some electrical power, which may either be provided with an external power supply or with batteries (which are normally rechargeable).
Battery-powered operation is of course convenient by eliminating another cable enter the requirement of a nearby power socket, but on the other hand the need for regular recharging can also be inconvenient.
Devices connected to a computer e.g. via USB cable can get the power from there.</p>

<h2>Trouble with Specifications</h2>
<p>Specifications for lasers and other photonics products are essential for the process of buying such things.
Nevertheless, many do not properly deal with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many product specifications by suppliers lack quality &ndash; they are incomplete, not sufficiently clear, etc.</li>
<li>Buyers are often not aware of what they really need. For example, they forget essential requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various problems can arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to a lack of clarity, tedious communications between supplier and buyer are required.</li>
<li>Product specifications raise expectations which cannot be met.</li>
<li>Conflicts can arise over such issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2013_12_13.html?banner=specifications">Photonics Spotlight article</a> and our <a href="./laser_specifications.html?banner=specifications">encyclopedia article on laser specifications</a> give you important hints. In case of doubt, <a href="./contact.html?banner=specifications">contact RP Photonics</a> to get competent and impartial advice.</p>
