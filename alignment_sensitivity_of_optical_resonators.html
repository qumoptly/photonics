<p>The performance of a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> often deteriorates seriously when one of its components is misaligned.
Typical effects are a drop of output power, a deteriorated <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, and increased <a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a>, apart from a modified output beam position and/or direction which can affect applications.</p>
<p>Misalignment may be caused not only by touching an optical element, but also by mechanical stress applied to the laser housing or by thermal effects.
The latter can arise from temperature changes in the laboratory or from heating caused by parts of the laser itself.
In <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power lasers</a>, it may be sufficient that some small fraction of the light as transmitted by a highly reflective <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirror</a> hits another mirror mount, and the resulting heating causes some bending through thermal expansion.
This can degrade the laser performance within a few minutes of operation.</p>
<p>In <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>, the effect of misalignment is often strongly related to a shift of the beam position in the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.
This beam position can be affected by the angular position of any optical element, in particular by tilting of mirrors.
Further, an effective misalignment can also result from a change in the pump beam position because this can cause some asymmetry of the <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lens</a>.
Such an asymmetry can cause the intracavity laser beam to be deflected.
The beam can also be affected by <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">gain guiding</a> if the <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> is high.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/alignment_sensitivity.png" alt="stability zones of a laser resonator, also showing the alignment sensitivity">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Stability zones of a laser resonator for variation of the thermal lens focusing power (which is proportional to the pump power). The solid lines show the beam radius at various locations, and the dashed curve shows the horizontal offset of the beam at the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> when the output coupler is tilted by 1&nbsp;mrad. The alignment sensitivity diverges at the left stability edge, and is much smaller in stability zone&nbsp;I (which is the right one in that case).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The straightforward (but not necessarily the most effective) way to reduce misalignment effects is to use very precise mechanics for alignment and a very stable mechanical laser setup, including a rigid base plate which is ideally somewhat decoupled from the laser housing.
It is also important, however, to know that the sensitivity of a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> against misalignment can depend strongly on the detailed <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a>.
In particular, for a stable resonator it depends on which <a href="stability_zones_of_optical_resonators.html" title="parameter regions of an optical resonator where the resonator is geometrically stable">stability zone</a> is chosen: zone&nbsp;I according to the nomenclature of Magni [2] can be an order of magnitude better than zone&nbsp;II (see Figure&nbsp;1).
The alignment sensitivity does even diverge at one of the edges of zone&nbsp;II.
Obviously, it is not advisable to operate a laser close to such a point, but this does happen since many laser resonators are designed without being aware of such issues.
Finally, a painfully sensitive alignment can result from operating a poorly designed TEM<sub>00</sub> laser in a situation where slight misalignment can cause the excitation of <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes">higher-order modes</a>.
Apart from good resonator design, carefully checking the pump intensity profile at an early stage can be a crucial measure.</p>
<p>Resonators with a large fundamental mode area are often particularly sensitive to misalignment.
In that regime, a solution with a so-called <a href="unstable_resonators.html" title="optical resonators which are dynamically unstable with respect to transverse beam offsets">unstable resonator</a> can be substantially more robust.</p>
<p>Misalignment also has a dynamic aspect: mechanical vibrations of resonator mirrors can translate into <a href="beam_pointing_fluctuations.html" title="fluctuations of the propagation direction of a laser beam">beam pointing fluctuations</a> of the output beam, and the resonator design determines how large this influence is.
Therefore, design optimization for low alignment sensitivity can also contribute good beam pointing stability.</p>
<p>There are a number of trade-offs in resonator design, e.g. between large mode sizes and low alignment sensitivity, or between zone-I operation and certain other properties.
Therefore, a good resonator design requires a comprehensive treatment of all requirements in order to find a good combination of resonator properties.
Although this can be a complicated task, it can be very worthwhile to engage in it because it can make a huge difference in performance.
The change from a type&nbsp;II to a type&nbsp;I resonator can make the alignment much easier and allow more output power to be obtained with better stability, even if the mode size in the gain medium is not modified.
It is also possible to shorten the required warm-up time of a laser by optimizing the design.</p>
