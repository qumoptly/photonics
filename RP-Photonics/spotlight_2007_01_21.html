<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">laser threshold</a>, <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a></p>
<p>It is known not to be a good idea to operate a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> only slightly above its <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">threshold</a>: it would sensitively react to changes in pump power or to internal disturbances, and the <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">power efficiency</a> would be low, because most of the pump power is translated into <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> of the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>.
On the other hand, operation far above threshold is not a problem, is it?</p>
<p>To begin with efficiency, operation far above threshold may not be good, since it requires a low <a href="output_couplers.html" title="partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupler</a> transmission, which can reduce the <a href="slope_efficiency.html" title="differential power efficiency of a laser">slope efficiency</a>.
But this may not always be the case, e.g. if there is plenty of laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> or the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">cavity</a> losses are very small.</p>
<p>Thermal effects tend to become stronger when the laser gain is increased by more strongly focusing the pump and laser radiation in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>.
<a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">Thermal lensing</a>, however, won't necessarily become a more pronounced effect, since a smaller laser mode is less sensitive to lensing.
This is often overlooked.</p>
<p>Another aspect is that the intracavity laser power will be high.
In particular, the laser intensity within the gain medium will be far above the <a href="saturation_power.html" title="a measure of the incident optical power required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation intensity</a>.
In principle this doesn't have to disturb the laser process; in most cases, the laser-active ions or atoms can be cycled around very quickly.
However, such high intensities can cause <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear effects</a>.
Particularly in <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>, there may be plenty of <a href="raman_gain.html" title="optical gain arising from stimulated Raman scattering">Raman gain</a>, causing the generation of significant power at some longer wavelength.
Excessive amounts of <a href="self_phase_modulation.html" title="nonlinear phase modulation of a beam, caused by its own intensity via the Kerr effect">self-phase modulation</a> may also not be beneficial.</p>
<p>Special aspects come into play in <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillators</a>, where back-conversion can occur and lead to a very complicated kind of interaction.
Particularly for <a href="synchronous_pumping.html" title="pumping of a laser or an optical parametric oscillator with short light pulses in synchronism with the emitted pulses">synchronously pumped</a> oscillators, this can seriously degrade the performance e.g. in terms of <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a>, <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and stability.
Such devices are often not pumped far above threshold &ndash; not because the <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump power</a> would be hard to exceed, but to avoid the mentioned detrimental effects.</p>
<p>While the particular reasons differ very much between different cases, the bottom line is very frequently that operation moderately above threshold, say with a pump power which 3 or 5 times above threshold (or perhaps somewhat less for OPOs), presents the best compromise: the power efficiency couldn't be much larger for higher <a href="pump_parameter.html" title="the ratio of pump power and threshold pump power of a laser">pump parameters</a>, and various detrimental effects are safely avoided.</p>
<p>However, operation far above threshold is unavoidable in some cases.
This can happen for <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> since their mode area can not be as easily increased as for <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>.
Also, <a href="passive_mode_locking.html" title="a technique of mode locking, based on a saturable absorber inside the laser resonator">passively</a> <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a> may have to be operated in this regime to avoid problems with <a href="q_switching_instabilities.html" title="instabilities of passively mode-locked lasers where the pulse energy is unstable">Q-switching instabilities</a>.
In any case, the question how far above threshold to operate is one of the essential issues of <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a>, and it is obviously helpful to have a detailed understanding of all involved physical effects.</p>

<h2>Photonics in Times of Trouble for International Trade</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">This <a href="./spotlight_2017_02_17.html?banner=International_trade">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> addresses the current serious concerns about the future of international trade and more generally international cooperation. Some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>German trade surplus</b> deserves attention, but claiming unfair practices without differentiating between different sectors of the economy is just stupid talk.</li>
<li>Already announced changes of US policy constitute a serious threat of beginning <b>trade wars</b>, which could have disastrous consequences.</li>
<li>There are also <b>ruthless attacks on essential values</b>, contributing to a breakdown of cooperation.</li>
<li>If we do not stop these developments in time, we may get into the <b>big crunch</b>.</li>
<li>We must <b>fiercely defend fundamental values</b> as well as <b>international cooperation</b>, because this is the only chance to solve a wide range of serious problems.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:14px;">You are welcome to <a href="./spotlight_2017_02_17.html?banner=International_trade">read the article</a>. Note that you can get the <a href="./spotlight.html?banner=International_trade">Photonics Spotlight</a> as an e-mail newsletter.</p>

It turns out that depending on the situation, quite different effects can come into play, and in most (but not all) cases it is most sensible to operate just a few times above threshold.",
