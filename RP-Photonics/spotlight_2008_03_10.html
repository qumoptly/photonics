<p>It is well known that <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear interactions</a> usually require <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase matching</a> to be efficient.
Essentially, the nonlinear mixing products generated at different locations e.g. within an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> or a <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal</a> are described by complex amplitudes, which don't sum up to large values unless they are added up <em>in phase</em>.
However, <em>some</em> nonlinearities appear not to require phase matching; examples are <a href="self_phase_modulation.html" title="nonlinear phase modulation of a beam, caused by its own intensity via the Kerr effect">self-phase modulation</a> and <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a>.
Are those phase-insensitive processes?
It turns out that this is not the case.
These processes <em>are</em> phase matching, but that condition is established automatically.
Different mechanisms can lead to such a situation.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="self_phase_modulation.html" title="nonlinear phase modulation of a beam, caused by its own intensity via the Kerr effect">self-phase modulation</a>, considered for a single-frequency signal e.g. within a fiber, the situation is simple: only one frequency component is involved, so there is no way in which differential phase shifts can be introduced.
More sophisticated is what happens with an <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a>, because this inevitably has some finite spectral width, so in that case differential phase shifts for different frequency components are possible, and these do have an effect.
But this leads us into <a href="four_wave_mixing.html" title="an interaction of light waves based on a &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity">four-wave mixing</a>, which indeed involves phase matching issues.
Note that four-wave mixing and self-phase modulation aren't just different kinds of nonlinearity; they are both consequences of the &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinear response of the medium, just in different situations concerning the optical spectrum.</p>
<p>The physics are again quite different for stimulated <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a>.
Here, energy is transferred from a shorter-wavelength pump wave to a longer-wavelength signal wave.
That transfer can actually again be described with amplitudes, and is surely not phase-insensitive.
However, it is done by the influence of an acoustic wave in the material, and that itself is generated by the pump and signal beam.
If the signal phase changes for any reason during propagation in the fiber, so does the local phase of the sound wave, and the mentioned transfer can always take place in the same direction.
So we have a process which is not phase-insensitive, but we don't have to care about phase matching, because we get it automatically.</p>
<p>The latter situation is somewhat analogous to <a href="parametric_amplification.html" title="a process of optical amplification based on a parametric nonlinearity">parametric amplification</a>, where an optical idler beam plays the role of the acoustic wave in Raman scattering.
The idler is also generated from pump and signal (via <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">difference frequency generation</a>), so that its phase is suitable for transferring power from the pump to the signal.
However, an important difference is that the idler wave propagates over long distances in the crystal, rather than being generated only locally.
Therefore, phase matching issues arise, and these involve all three waves: pump, signal and idler.</p>
<p>There is actually a situation where parametric amplification is more similar to Raman scattering: when the nonlinear crystal is strongly absorbing for the idler wave, see <a href="spotlight_2007_12_11.html">The Photonics Spotlight 2007-12-11</a>.
Indeed, the <a href="phase_matching_bandwidth.html" title="the width of an optical frequency range in which some process (e.g. a nonlinear interaction) can be efficient due to more or less precise phase matching">phase-matching bandwidth</a> can be strongly increased in that case &ndash; at the price, however, that the parametric gain is much lower.</p>
