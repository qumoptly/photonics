<p>Infrared light is <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> with a vacuum <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> longer than &asymp;&thinsp;700&ndash;800&nbsp;nm, the upper limit of the visible wavelength range.
That limit is not well-defined, as the <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> of the eye is reduced very gradually in that spectral region.
Although the responsivity e.g. at 700&nbsp;nm is already very low, even the light from some <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> at wavelengths beyond 750&nbsp;nm can be seen if that light is sufficiently intense.
Such light may be harmful for the eye even if it is not perceived as very bright.
The upper limit of the infrared spectral region in terms of wavelength is also not precisely defined; it is usually understood to be roughly 1&nbsp;mm.</p>
<p>Different definitions are used for distinguishing different infrared spectral regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>near-infrared</em> spectral region (also called IR-A) is normally understood to range from &asymp;&thinsp;700 to 1400&nbsp;nm.
<a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">Lasers</a> emitting in this wavelength region are particularly hazardous for the eye, as near-infrared light is transmitted and focused to the sensitive retina in the same way as visible light, while not triggering the protective blink reflex.
Adequate <a href="eye_protection.html" title="the protection of eyes against laser hazards">eye protection</a> is then very important.</li>
<li>The <em>short-wavelength infrared</em> (SWIR, IR-B) extends from 1.4 to 3&nbsp;&mu;m.
This region is relatively <a href="eye_safe_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting in a wavelength region with relatively low hazards for the human eye">eye-safe</a>, since such light is absorbed in the eye before it can reach the retina.
<a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a> for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, for example, operate in that region.</li>
<li>The <em>mid-infrared</em> (mid-wave infrared, MWIR, IR-C) ranges from 3 to 8&nbsp;&mu;m.
The atmosphere exhibits strong <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> in parts of that region; there are many absorption lines e.g. of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O).
Many gases exhibit strong and characteristic mid-IR absorption lines, which makes this spectral region interesting for highly sensitive trace gas <a href="laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="methods of absorption spectroscopy using laser light">laser absorption spectroscopy</a>.</li>
<li>The <em>long-wavelength infrared</em> (LWIR, IR-C) ranges from 8 to 15&nbsp;&mu;m.
It is followed by the <em>far infrared</em> (FIR), which ranges to 1&nbsp;mm and is sometimes understood to start at 8&nbsp;&mu;m already.
This spectral region is used for <a href="thermal_imaging.html" title="imaging based on thermal radiation">thermal imaging</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the definitions of these terms vary substantially in the literature.
For example, the mid-infrared already ends at 5&nbsp;&mu;m for some, while others regard it as ranging up to 30&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
<p>Most <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">glasses</a> are transparent for near-infrared light but are strongly absorbing for longer wavelengths, where <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a> can be directly converted to <a href="phonons.html" title="quantized microscopic vibrations in solid media">phonons</a>.
For silica glass, as used e.g. for <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>, strong absorption occurs beyond &asymp;&thinsp;2&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
<p>Infrared light is also called <em>heat radiation</em>, since <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">thermal radiation</a> from hot bodies is mostly within the infrared region.
Even at room temperature and below, bodies emit significant amounts of mid- and far-infrared light, which can be used for thermal imaging.
For example, infrared images of a heated house in winter can reveal leaks of heat (e.g. at windows, roofs, or poorly insulated walls behind radiators) and thus help to efficiently direct measures for improvement.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Infrared Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Many optical elements working in the visible spectral range can also work well in the near infrared, possibly with modified <a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">dielectric coatings</a>.
For longer wavelengths (mid and far infrared), one requires special <a href="infrared_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems which are suitable for infrared light">infrared optics</a>, which are often based on <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">optical materials</a> with low phonon energies in order to obtain a long infrared absorption edge.
See the article on <a href="infrared_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems which are suitable for infrared light">infrared optics</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Sources for Infrared Radiation</h2>
<div>
<p>Most <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>, for example <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG lasers</a>, many <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and the most powerful <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>, emit near-infrared light.
There are comparatively few laser sources for the mid- and far-infrared spectral regions.
<a href="co2_lasers.html" title="infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules">CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</a> can emit at 10.6&nbsp;&mu;m and some other wavelengths in that region.
Typical problems with <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> for solid-state mid-IR lasers are the limited transparency range of the host crystal and the tendency for fast <a href="multi_phonon_transitions.html" title="transitions between electronic levels of atoms or ions in solid media, involving the emission of multiple phonons">multi-phonon transitions</a> bypassing the <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transition</a>; crystal materials with very low phonon energies are required.
Cryogenic lead-salt lasers were in earlier years often used for mid-infrared spectroscopy, but are now rivaled by <a href="quantum_cascade_lasers.html" title="semiconductor lasers relying on intersubband transitions, normally emitting in the mid-infrared spectral region">quantum cascade lasers</a>, which partly even achieve continuous-wave operation at room temperature.
<a href="free_electron_lasers.html" title="laser devices where light amplification occurs by interaction with fast electrons in an undulator">Free electron lasers</a> can be used as broadly tunable and very powerful sources of infrared light.</p>
<p>Outside the area of lasers, there are other kinds of <a href="infrared_emitters.html" title="devices emitting infrared radiation">infrared emitters</a>, particularly infrared <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light emitting diodes</a> (LEDs) and thermal emitters, the latter generating <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">thermal radiation</a>.</p>
<p>Ordinary light bulbs (<a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">incandescent lamps</a>), generating <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">thermal radiation</a>, emit substantially more infrared light than visible light; this is the essential reason for their very limited power conversion efficiency of the order of 5&ndash;10&#37;.
Sun light also has strong infrared components.</p>
<p>Infrared light can also be generated via <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>.
For example, mid-infrared light can be generated by <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">difference frequency generation</a> in <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a>, or with <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillators</a>.
See also the article on <a href="mid_infrared_laser_sources.html" title="light sources emitting mid-infrared radiation in the form of a laser-like beam">mid-infrared laser sources</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Detection of Infrared Light</h2>
<div>
<p>Many types of <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> are suitable for detecting infrared light.
For example, <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> based on semiconductors with a sufficiently small <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a> can be used.
However, detectors for e.g. the mid-infrared region require such a small bandgap energy that carriers can be excited not only by light, but also via thermal energy, because the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> energy is not much larger than <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i></span> at room temperature.
Therefore, <a href="infrared_detectors.html" title="detectors for infrared light">infrared detectors</a> often have to be cooled to fairly low temperatures in order to increase their sensitivity.
The same holds for <a href="infrared_cameras.html" title="cameras which work with infrared light">infrared cameras</a>.</p>
<p>Particularly for near-infrared light, there are <a href="infrared_viewers.html" title="instruments for observing scenes with infrared light"><em>infrared viewers</em></a>, where infrared light from some scenery is imaged onto an infrared-sensitive <a href="photocathodes.html" title="an electrode where electrons can be released based on the photoelectric effect">photocathode</a>, and generated photoelectrons are accelerated with a high voltage to a fluorescent screen, which then displays the image e.g. in green color.
Such IR viewers are used e.g. in laser labs for tracking infrared <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>.</p>
<p>There are also photocathode materials which allow the operation of <a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultipliers</a> in the infrared.</p>
<p>Low-cost tools for visualizing infrared light are <a href="laser_viewing_cards.html" title="cards used for visualizing laser beams in non-visible spectral regions">laser viewing cards</a> which emit visible light (or change their color) when hits by infrared light.</p>
<p>Quite high detection sensitivities are possible with <a href="upconversion.html" title="a process where light can be emitted with photon energies higher than those of the light generating the excitation">upconversion</a> of infrared light into the visible.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Removal of Infrared Light</h2>
<div>
<p>In illumination systems based on <a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">incandescent lamps</a>, e.g. in high-power image projectors, the produced infrared radiation is useless and can cause detrimental effects.
Therefore, certain heat control filters have been developed for removing infrared light.
They can be realized in the form of <a href="cold_mirrors.html" title="mirrors which can reduce the heat load in an optical system by reflecting only visible radiation">cold mirrors</a> or <a href="hot_mirrors.html" title="mirrors which can reduce the heat load in an optical system by reflecting infrared radiation">hot mirrors</a>.</p>

<h2>Your Lab is Closed due to the Corona Virus Crisis?</h2>
<p>Time to think how to best utilize your time!</p>
<p>Here is a suggestion: <br> <b>Consider to start with physical modeling!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Build models for your existing or planned lasers and amplifiers, resonators, etc.</li>
<li>Utilize such models in order to <b>improve your qualitative and quantitative understanding</b>, solve problems, optimize device performance and <b>develop new ideas</b>.</li>
<li>Power up your home office instead of wasting your time!</li>
<li>When getting back to the lab, restart with fresh plans and full power.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
</ul>
