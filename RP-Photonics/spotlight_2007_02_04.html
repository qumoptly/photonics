<p>High power fiber lasers and amplifiers have of course been a very important topic at the conferences Photonics West in San Jose, January 20-25, and Advanced Solid-State Photonics (ASSP) in Vancouver, January 28-31.
Quite a number of talks addressed the quest for larger mode areas, as this issue has been recognized as the central bottleneck which has to be overcome in order to continue the recent enormous performance enhancements.
(See the previous spotlight articles on this topic as mentioned above.)
Quite some creativity has been unleashed in the context of attempts to tackle this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandia National Labs is optimizing refractive index profiles for very large mode areas (talk 6453-48 at Photonics West).
Some combined power-law design was found to exhibit better performance than e.g. square-law or triangular profile fibers.</li>
<li>Fitel reported on distributed mode filtering in a cladding-pumped amplifier (talk 6453-15 at Photonics West).
This technique makes it possible to suppress <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes">higher-order modes</a> as well as to filter out <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">ASE</a>.</li>
<li>Researchers at the University of Michigan, collaborating with the company Nufern, have demonstrated a fiber with chirally-coupled core (talk ME2 at ASSP).
This contains a second core would around the central core.
The idea is basically to obtain phase-matched coupling e.g. of the <a href="lp_modes.html" title="linearly polarized modes of optical fibers with radially symmetric index profiles in the approximation of weak guidance">LP<sub>11</sub> mode</a> to the lossy chiral core, hoping to suppress all higher-order modes of the multimode core even at large mode areas.</li>
<li>IMRA reported an impressive mode area of about 3000&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> in an ytterbium-doped leakage channel fiber (talk 6453-42 at Photonics West and ME3 at ASSP).
This is a <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fiber</a> made so that the core supports several modes, but higher-order modes are strongly attenuated by leakage through gaps between the air holes.</li>
<li>Femlight uses a 60-cm long rod-type photonic crystal fiber which has to be kept straight (talk ME4 at ASSP).
The concept is essentially to live with a very weakly guiding core by avoiding any bending.
Quite short pulses with up to 50&nbsp;W average power are generated with high efficiency.
However, such a device is actually no more used like a normal fiber; it is more like a long bulk crystal with some built-in weak guiding mechanism.</li>
<li>The probably most radical approach is based on a concept developed by the famous Anthony E. Siegman: abandon the generally used method of index guiding altogether and replace it with <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">gain guiding</a>!
Talk ME1 at ASSP presented the first experimental demonstration of this concept, using a neodymium-doped fiber which is anti-guiding when being unpumped but nevertheless exhibits well-behaved modes due to gain guiding.
This was demonstrated with the rather unconventional experimental approach of pumping the fiber with a <a href="xenon_lamps.html" title="lamps based on an electrical discharge in xenon gas">xenon flashlamp</a>.
While the results are certainly encouraging, with an apparently already rather large mode area, the researchers are not yet able to fully assess the potential of their method.</li>
</ul>
<p>It remains to be seen how far we will get with all these approaches.
So far, it is not clear whether we will obtain a practical approach for realizing more areas e.g. of 10,000&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> in fibers with reasonable handling properties.
Fore sure, many people will continue to work hard in this direction, and obviously a breakthrough can be very rewarding.</p>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
