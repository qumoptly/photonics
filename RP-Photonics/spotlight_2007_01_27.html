<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="noise_figure.html" title="a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a>, <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">amplifier noise</a>, <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a></p>
<p>The noise figure of an amplifier (e.g. a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a>) is often said to simply be the amount by which the signal-to-noise ratio of an input signal is degraded.
Then, however, it is not understandable how the noise figure of an ideal high-<a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">four-level</a> amplifier can always be 3&nbsp;dB.
In particular, how about two such amplifiers in series?
If the signal-to-noise ratio is degraded twice, the noise figure should be 6&nbsp;dB.
But considering the two amplifiers as a single amplifier (made as an <a href="amplifier_chains.html" title="amplifiers consisting of several stages">amplifier chain</a>), it should be 3&nbsp;dB.
It is not conceivable why e.g. two fiber amplifiers in series should be worse concerning <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">amplifier noise</a> than a single longer amplifier.</p>
<p>The confusion arises from the frequently encountered omission of an important condition: the noise figure is the amount by which the signal-to-noise ratio of an input signal is degraded, <em>if the input signal is <a href="shot_noise.html" title="quantum-limited intensity noise">shot-noise</a> limited</em>.
In a chain made of two high-gain amplifiers, the first device may have a shot-noise limited input.
Its output will then have strongly amplified quantum noise, plus some excess noise according to the noise figure.
This means that the input of the second amplifier has strong excess noise (i.e., noise at a level high above the shot noise level), so that this amplifier won't degrade the noise performance further if it also has a noise figure of e.g. 3&nbsp;dB.</p>
<p>The exact analog of this occurs with electronic amplifiers, only that <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a> has to be replaced with thermal noise.
Obviously, the apparent mystery as described above is not one of these quantum mysteries, and is relatively simple to resolve.
And the understanding of such issues is obviously quite important when considering amplifier noise, e.g. in <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetection</a> and particularly in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>. </p>

<h2>Evaluation of Technologies</h2>
<p>In the laser and photonics industry, it is often essential to obtain competent evaluations of certain technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CTO of a laser company needs to know whether some new technical idea is worthwhile pursuing. Maybe there are some hidden problems?</li>
<li>A user of lasers is told about a great new laser architecture &ndash; but will it really serve her needs?</li>
<li>Venture capital firms need to find out what the potentials and limitations of certain technologies are. We call that applying <em>due diligence</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Get help!</h3>
<p>Involving a top expert such as <a href="./paschotta.html?banner=technology_evaluation">Dr. Paschotta</a> into technology evaluations can have many advantages:</p>

<h2>Shortages of rare earth materials &ndash; a problem for photonics?</h2>
<p>Photonics heavily depends on the supply of rare earth materials in various areas &ndash; think of <a href="./laser_crystals.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">laser crystals</a>, <a href="./rare_earth_doped_fibers.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">active fibers</a> and <a href="./light_emitting_diodes.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">LEDs</a>, for example.
It is hard to see how such things could be done without rare earth materials.
And those have recently been subject to enormous price increases and were even involved in a trade war.</p>
<p>Is that now a reason for serious concerns in the area of photonics?
Do we need to undertake serious recycling efforts?
Our <a href="./spotlight_2014_06_27.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">Photonics Spotlight article</a> analyzes the situation.</p>
<p>Receiving the <a href="./spotlight.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">Photonics Spotlight</a> via our <a href="./newsletters.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">newsletter</a> might be a good idea &hellip;</p>
