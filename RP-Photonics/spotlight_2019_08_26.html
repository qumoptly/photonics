<p>Abstract: It is explained what unpolarized light really is, and whether light can be unpolarized when it is (pseudo-)monochromatic.</p>
</div>

<p>At a first glance, one may think that the optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of light and its <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a> are totally unrelated things, and many people may answer the question &ldquo;Can monochromatic light be unpolarized&rdquo; with &ldquo;Sure, why not?&rdquo;.
However, it actually turns out to be an interesting and non-trivial question.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">What is Unpolarized Light?</h2>
<div>
<p>We need to think about what it really means for light to be unpolarized.
In any moment of time where the electric field at a certain position in space doesn't happen to be zero, the electric field vector points in a certain direction.
In that sense, light is always polarized!
However, there are situations where the orientation of the electric field vector fluctuates such that when averaging over a certain time interval we do not find any preferred field orientation &ndash; the light is then indeed unpolarized.</p>
<p>We can also consider a situation where the electric field vector systematically rotates around the propagation axis.
If the rotation frequency equals the <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>, we then have circularly (or elliptically) polarized light, for lower rotation frequencies linearly polarized light with a rotating polarization direction &ndash; in any case, no unpolarized light!
So for unpolarized light we indeed need random fluctuations, not a systematic evolution of field vector direction.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fluctuations Imply Non-Monochromacy</h2>
<div>
<p>Now it is clear that such fluctuations, which are indispensable for light to be unpolarized, cannot occur for strictly <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic light</a>, because there we cannot have any fluctuations &ndash; only a perfectly periodic oscillation of electrical and magnetic field.
In conclusion, strictly monochromatic light cannot be unpolarized.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Quasi-monochromatic Light</h3>
<div>
<p>In practice, however, we are often dealing with <em>quasi-monochromatic light</em>.
That means that the optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> is so small that in some respects it is equivalent to a zero bandwidth.
For example, we could not resolve the optical spectrum with any ordinary <a href="optical_spectrum_analyzers.html" title="instruments for measuring optical spectra">optical spectrum analyzer</a>.
As a numerical example, we may have a bandwidth of 1&nbsp;MHz, which is orders of magnitude less than the mean <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>, which is hundreds of terahertz for visible light.
That bandwidth implies that we can have significant changes of field vector direction within one microsecond (the inverse of the bandwidth).
When averaging over 1&nbsp;ms, for example, we may find the light to be completely unpolarized.
In such a situation, one could say that although the light is quasi-monochromatic in some sense (e.g. for our spectrum analyzer), it is sufficiently non-monochromatic to be unpolarized.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Divergent Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>We often consider only <a href="plane_waves.html" title="waves with plane wavefronts">plane waves</a>, representing the mathematically simplest field distribution.
However, we can also think about a <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">divergent beam</a>, which can be considered to be a linear superposition of plane waves with somewhat different propagation directions.
(This idea is the basis of <a href="fourier_optics.html" title="the description of light propagation based on transverse spatial Fourier transforms">Fourier optics</a>.)
Now we might assume that the different plane waves do not only differ in terms of propagation direction, but also a randomly varying polarization directions.
Couldn't that lead to unpolarized light even if it is perfectly monochromatic?</p>
<p>When inspecting the electric field at any fixed point in the beam profile, the answer is no; the arguments presented above fully apply.
However, we may get unpolarized light in the weak sense that the transmission of <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> of the complete beam through a <a href="polarizers.html" title="optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizer</a> will be independent of the orientation of that polarizer.
That is not truly unpolarized light, however: the transmission trough a polarizer will exhibit a fixed spatial pattern.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Polarization Scramblers</h2>
<div>
<p>There are devices (called <em>depolarizers</em> or <em>polarization scramblers</em>) which can be used for converting polarized light into unpolarized light.
Our discussion makes clear that those need to introduce some fluctuating time dependence, if we need unpolarized light at every location across the beam profile.
For example, one may use a <a href="pockels_cells.html" title="electro-optic devices, used for building modulators">Pockels cell</a> which is driven with a randomly fluctuating electric signal (or a combination of multiple cells).
With such kind of devices, one can for example depolarize a linearly polarized <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>.
The shorter the measurement time over which the light needs to be unpolarized, the larger must be the bandwidth of the applied noise modulation.</p>
<p>Note that we then still have a strong correlation of field vector orientations across the beam profile &ndash; in contrast to a beam of sunlight, for example.</p>
<p>Clearly, unpolarized light is more difficult to understand than polarized light, essentially because it involves statistical aspects.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">But we don't want bigot ignorants to make political decisions and educate our children!</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">For example, <b>global warming</b> is not a matter of political opinion, but a fact.
