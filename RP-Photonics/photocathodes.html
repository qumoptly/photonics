<p>A photocathode is an electrode made from a photoemissive material from which electrons can be released into free space via the external <a href="photoelectric_effect.html" title="the emission or excitation of electric carriers related to the absorption of light">photoelectric effect</a>.
Using another electrode, called the anode, which is held at a substantially more positive electric potential, one can pull the photoelectrons away from the photocathode and obtain a <a href="photocurrent.html" title="an electric current which is induced by incident light in a photodetector">photocurrent</a>, which is proportional to the incident <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> over a wide dynamic range.</p>
<p>This effect is what is essentially used in a <a href="phototubes.html" title="gas-filled or vacuum tubes which can be used as photodetectors">phototube</a>.
Photocathodes are also used in other kind of <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> devices, namely in <a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultipliers</a>, and also in <a href="infrared_viewers.html" title="instruments for observing scenes with infrared light">infrared viewers</a>, <a href="streak_cameras.html" title="devices for measuring the power of an optical pulse versus time">streak cameras</a>, <a href="image_intensifiers_and_image_converters.html" title="instruments which can intensify images acquired under faint light conditions, or convert images to other wavelengths">image intensifiers</a> (image amplifiers) and <a href="image_intensifiers_and_image_converters.html" title="instruments which can intensify images acquired under faint light conditions, or convert images to other wavelengths">image converters</a>.
Besides, pulsed photocathodes, which are illuminated with <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort laser pulses</a>, are used in some particle accelerators.</p>
<p>Photocathodes must generally be operated in a high vacuum &ndash; typically within an evacuated glass tube.
The spectral sensitivity can then be limited by the transparency of the used <a href="optical_windows.html" title="flat transparent plates with optical quality, used for protection against the environment">optical window</a> material.
For example, ultraviolet detectors may be equipped with a magnesium fluoride optical window, which is transparent for light with wavelengths above 115&nbsp;nm.
Others work with UV glasses with a short wavelength cut-off around 185&nbsp;nm, for example, or with borosilicate glasses for transmission from 0.3&nbsp;&mu;m on.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Reflection-mode and Transmission-mode Photocathodes</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout red">&ldquo;Reflective&rdquo; photocathode should actually not reflect much light!</aside>
<p>Thick photocathodes, e.g. consisting of an opaque metal plate, can emit electrons only on the illuminated side.
They are called <em>reflective</em> or <em>reflection-mode</em> cathodes, although they of course work with absorbed rather than with reflected light.
Their <a href="reflectivity.html" title="the ratio of reflected optical power to the incident optical power at a surface">reflectivity</a> should not be high in the wavelength region of interest.</p>
<p>Various devices contain very thin photocathodes, where photoelectrons can be extracted on the opposite side.
Such transmission-mode photocathodes are needed for <a href="image_intensifiers_and_image_converters.html" title="instruments which can intensify images acquired under faint light conditions, or convert images to other wavelengths">image intensifiers</a>, for example, where electrodes strongly limit the access of light on their side, and also for head-on <a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultipliers</a>.
Since electrons cannot travel over substantial distances in a material without strongly interacting with it, transmission-type photocathodes require that light can propagates through them &ndash; while at the same time there must be substantial <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a>, since unabsorbed light can of course not produce any photoelectrons.
Therefore, transmission-type photocathodes need to be very thin, e.g. made as a thin film deposited on the inner side of a glass tube.
Their <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a> is typically somewhat lower than that of reflective photocathodes.</p>
<p>The sensitivity at the long-wavelength edge can be substantially reduced when using thin films, exhibiting only a limited amount of absorption in that spectral region.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Work Function, Spectral Range and Quantum Efficiency</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">The work function determines the long-wavelength cut-off.</aside>
<p>Normally, electron emission is possible only when the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon energy</a> exceeds the work function of the material, which is the amount of energy required for releasing an electron into free space.
The work function of the material thus determines the maximum possible optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> for which the external photoelectric effect can occur.
Only at very high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a>, nonlinear processes are possible where multiple photons combine their energy to excite a single electron.</p>
<p>Many photoemissive materials have a work function which allows the operation with visible and ultraviolet, but not with infrared light.
Others have a large work function and are suitable only for short wavelengths in the ultraviolet, e.g. below 200&nbsp;nm.
Semiconductor materials with low <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap</a> energy are used for infrared detection.</p>
<p>The photoelectric effect usually works well for higher photon energies, well above the work function.
The short-wavelength edge of the spectral range is often not limited by the photocathode, but by the transmission of the optical window.
Sometimes, the spectral range is intentionally reduced by using some kind of <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filter</a>.
For example, <a href="infrared_detectors.html" title="detectors for infrared light">infrared detectors</a> are often made insensitive to visible and <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> light.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Incomplete absorption is a main limiting factor for the quantum efficiency.</aside>
<p>Not every incident photon can generate a photoelectrons, since some of the photons may be reflected or (for a thin cathode) transmitted or scattered away instead of being absorbed, and not even every absorbed photon may provide a photoelectron.
The average number of photoelectrons per incident photon, or the probability of one photon to generate a photoelectron, is called the <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a> of the photocathode.
Typically, it drops sharply when the optical wavelength approaches the maximum possible one, defined by the work function.
Some photocathode materials (see below) reach quantum efficiencies of more than 30&#37; in some spectral region, while others (particularly those for the infrared) are limited to the order of 10&#37; or even substantially lower.</p>
<p>The quantum efficiency of a photocathode also depends on the applied electric field, particularly in the range of small field strengths.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Resistance</h2>
<div>
<p>Photocathodes made as thin semiconductor films can have a substantial electrical resistance.
That limits their ability to deliver high photocurrents, i.e., to operate with high input light levels.
The available dynamic range is then decreased accordingly.</p>
<p>Note that the resistance can be substantially increased for low-temperature operation, as required for low-noise detection.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Dark Current from Thermionic Emission</h2>
<div>
<p>Photocathodes can exhibit some amount of <a href="dark_current.html" title="a current from a photodetector which occurs even in the absence of a light input">dark current</a>, which results from thermionic emission: electrons can receive sufficient energy from formal processes, so that they can leave the material without any incident light.
This detrimental process is particularly relevant for applications like <a href="photon_counting.html" title="photodetection at low light levels where single photon absorption events are counted">photon counting</a>, where the false dark count rate is a seriously limiting performance parameter.</p>
<p>Thermionic emission is often very weak at room temperature, unless for materials with small work function, as required for <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> detection.
In such cases, a photocathode may need to be cooled in order to reduce the dark current.</p>
<p>Note that the temperature also somewhats effects the photocurrent.
Photocathodes usually have a negative temperature coefficient (i.e., reduced current for higher temperatures), except for wavelengths close to the long-wavelength cutoff, where thermally assisted processes support the excitation.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Pulsed Operation</h2>
<div>
<p>Some particle accelerators, as used in <a href="free_electron_lasers.html" title="laser devices where light amplification occurs by interaction with fast electrons in an undulator">free electron lasers</a>, for example, contain a pulsed photocathode as an <em>electron gun</em>, i.e., for generating pulsed electron beams with extremely high brightness.
The emission is spatially limited by tightly focusing and <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> on the photocathode, and very tight temporal confinement is achieved due to the ultrashort pulse durations (typically in the picosecond region).</p>
<p>While the quantum efficiency is not of uttermost importance in that case, one requires a photoemissive material with high conductivity, because the peak electric current can be rather high (e.g. tens of amperes).
The photoelectrons are rapidly accelerated in a strong radio frequency field, to which the laser pulses are synchronized.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Lifetime</h2>
<div>
<p>Photocathodes can have very long lifetimes (tens of thousands of hours), but accelerated aging can occur under various circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some photocathodes exhibit some aging even when being stored at room temperature; they should thus be kept as cool as possible.
In any case, storage or operation at increased temperatures can reduce the lifetime.</li>
<li>Some photocathodes should not be exposed to any intense light, for example daylight, because they can degrade or even be completely damaged.</li>
<li>In devices operated with high voltages, for example in <a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultipliers</a>, problems can be caused by bombardment of the photocathode with positive ions (which a negatively charged electrode attracts); that creates crystal defects which can absorb light without generating photoelectrons.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Photocathode Materials</h2>
<div>
<p>Many different photocathode materials have been developed, and the selection of the material depends mainly on the required performance parameters, essentially on the <a href="spectral_response_of_a_photodetector.html" title="the range of optical wavelengths for which a photodetector is sensitive">spectral response</a> (determined mainly by the work function) and the quantum efficiency, apart from the suitability for reflection or transmission mode.
Some important photocathode materials are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sb-Cs (cesium&ndash;antimony, Cs<sub>3</sub>Sb) is widely used in the visible and ultraviolet region, mostly for reflective photocathodes.
It can be relatively simply fabricated by evaporating an antimony film onto a glass plate and then evaporating cesium onto it.</li>
<li>Bialkali materials like Sb-Rb-Cs / Sb-K-Cs offer sensitivity in a wide spectral range similar to Sb-Cs, combined with lower dark currents, i.e., lower <a href="noise_equivalent_power.html" title="the input power to a detector which produces the same signal output power as the internal noise of the device">noise-equivalent power</a> and thus higher sensitivity.
There are also materials containing three or more kinds of alkaline metals, which achieve a still wider spectral response from the near infrared to the ultraviolet, but are more difficult to produce.</li>
<li>Some high-temperature alkali materials like Sb-Na-K are optimized for operation at higher temperatures without excessive dark currents; this is needed for some applications in hot environments.</li>
<li>Ag-O-Cs is a broadband material, sensitive roughly between 300&nbsp;nm and 1.2&nbsp;&mu;m.
With its relatively small work function, it extends further into the infrared than some other materials, but exhibits higher dark currents.
The quantum efficiency is low and can drop further under conditions of intense illumination.</li>
<li>Semiconductors like GaAs and InGaAs can be activated with cesium for obtaining a wide spectral response from the near infrared to the ultraviolet.
A higher indium (In) content extends the response further into the infrared.</li>
<li>For a particularly extended infrared response, e.g. up to 1.6&nbsp;&mu;m, there are <em>field-assisted photocathodes</em>, containing a p&ndash;n junction e.g. between InP (at the surface) and InGaAsP or InGaAs.
The photoemission is substantially enhanced by applying a bias voltage to the p&ndash;n junction.
Such photocathodes usually need to be operated at low temperatures in order to limit the dark current.</li>
<li>Cs-I and Cs-Te are solar blind materials, being sensitive only for wavelength below 200&nbsp;nm (Cs-I) and 300&nbsp;nm (Cs-Te), respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The spectral response of a photocathode in combination with a certain window material is often specified with an &ldquo;S designation&rdquo; according to a system established by the Electronics Industries Association.
For example, an S1 photocathode is made from Ag-O-Cs in combination with a borosilicate or lime glass window.
(Different glasses can be used, as long as the absorption age is around 300&nbsp;nm.)
Different as designations can occur for the same photocathode material when using different glasses.</p>
<p>In principle, one could also use simple metals; many early experiments worked with them.
However, they exhibit quite low quantum efficiencies.</p>

<h2>Free Tutorial: Modeling of Fiber Amplifiers and Lasers</h2>
<p>We have published a new <a href="./tutorial_modeling.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">tutorial</a> which discusses the modeling of fiber amplifiers and lasers.
It addresses many questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a <a href="./tutorial_modeling1.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">model</a>?</li>
<li>Should one use <a href="./tutorial_modeling3.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">power propagation or field propagation</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate the behavior of <a href="./tutorial_modeling4.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">laser-active ions</a>?</li>
<li>How to calculate <a href="./tutorial_modeling5.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">steady-state solutions</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate <a href="./tutorial_modeling6.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">dynamical behavior</a> and <a href="./tutorial_modeling7.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">ultrashort pulse propagation</a>?</li>
<li>What aspects are important for the <a href="./tutorial_modeling8.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">decision</a> whether to develop own modeling software or use commercial software?</li>
</ul>
