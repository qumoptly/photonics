<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling of lasers</a>, <a href="nanofibers.html" title="optical fibers with transverse dimensions below one micrometer">nanofibers</a>, <a href="thresholdless_lasers.html" title="lasers with a threshold power which is virtually zero">thresholdless lasers</a></p>
<p>Although many people are interested in <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> with higher output powers, it is not altogether stupid to consider how we could get down to <em>lower</em> powers.
It will of course not be a satisfactory solution simply to operate a laser closer and closer to the <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">laser threshold</a>, since this would make the device very inefficient and also sensitive to tiny fluctuations of the pump power.
The ideal thing would be a systematic procedure telling us exactly how to construct lasers with lower and lower output powers, without spoiling essential features such as the <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">power efficiency</a> and stability.
So this is clearly an issue of <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling</a> &ndash; only this time in downward direction!</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Scaling of Mode Areas</h2>
<div>
<p>While the main challenge for scaling toward higher powers is often in the domain of thermal effects (e.g. <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> or <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">crystal</a> fracture), lower output powers with preserved power efficiency require lower <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump powers</a>.
What can we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchanging the material of the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> (e.g. with one having a higher <a href="gain_efficiency.html" title="small-signal gain of an optical amplifier per unit pump power or per unit stored energy">gain efficiency</a>) can help, but this is not power scaling, since it is a non-repeatable measure.</li>
<li>We also wouldn't get far by reducing the resonator losses, since the efficiency would then more and more be compromised by parasitic losses, and there is normally no systematic procedure to reduce those.</li>
<li>So the only way is to reduce the <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> in the gain medium in proportion to the power level, while keeping the laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, the resonator losses and the length of the gain medium constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we get down in mode area, the effect of <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> becomes stronger and stronger.
Once the <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> becomes significantly smaller than the length of the gain medium, we have to use a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>.
A conventional type of optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> with a doped <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> will be limiting, since it would require a higher and higher <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> (NA), i.e., a higher and higher <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> contrast.
A wide range for power scaling will be obtained for fibers with a very high NA, where one can reduce the waveguide diameter significantly below the wavelength.
So we get into the domain of <a href="nanofibers.html" title="optical fibers with transverse dimensions below one micrometer">nanofibers</a> (also called <em>photonic nanowires</em>)!
I am actually not aware of laser-active nanofibers, but this would seem to be an interesting area of research.
A challenge will probably be to efficiently inject pump light (via a fiber taper?).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Another Way to Lower the Pump Threshold</h2>
<div>
<p>An altogether different approach is that of the <a href="thresholdless_lasers.html" title="lasers with a threshold power which is virtually zero">thresholdless laser</a>.
The key idea is modify the surroundings of the active area so as to suppress <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> into unused modes of the radiation field.
In that way, one avoids the power loss via spontaneous emission, which is the fundamental reason for a non-zero threshold power.
This principle can be applied e.g. to <a href="vertical_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="a monolithic kind of semiconductor lasers with beam emission perpendicular to the wafer surface">vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers</a>, leading to threshold pump powers well below 1&nbsp;mW.</p>
<p>In any case, power scaling in the downward direction doesn't appear to be entirely simple, at least if one wants to penetrate the regime of threshold powers far below 1&nbsp;mW.
And as for <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high power lasers</a>, ideas for truly scalable approaches are rare.</p>

<h2>Shortages of rare earth materials &ndash; a problem for photonics?</h2>
<p>Photonics heavily depends on the supply of rare earth materials in various areas &ndash; think of <a href="./laser_crystals.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">laser crystals</a>, <a href="./rare_earth_doped_fibers.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">active fibers</a> and <a href="./light_emitting_diodes.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">LEDs</a>, for example.
It is hard to see how such things could be done without rare earth materials.
And those have recently been subject to enormous price increases and were even involved in a trade war.</p>
<p>Is that now a reason for serious concerns in the area of photonics?
Do we need to undertake serious recycling efforts?
