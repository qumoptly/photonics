<p><a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">Lasers</a> are often said to be special light sources because they emit <em>coherent</em> light, whereas other light sources are incoherent.
However, is this really a &ldquo;black and white&rdquo; issue?</p>
<p>Beginning with <b>spatial coherence</b>, there can really be gradual differences.
Many lasers exhibit nearly the highest possible degree of spatial coherence, which would imply perfectly well-defined wavefronts of the output.
Others exhibit a substantially reduced degree of spatial coherence, which is associated with a reduced <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
Compared with some really &ldquo;incoherent&rdquo; light source such as an <a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">incandescent lamp</a>, the spatial coherence is still very high &ndash; sufficient to form a well directed laser beam, even if its focusability is not as high as for some other <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>.
That big difference in the degree of coherence between even poor lasers and other light sources justifies the practice of calling lasers coherent light sources, in contrast to incoherent sources like bulbs.</p>
<p>Concerning <b>temporal coherence</b>, the situation is somewhat more complicated.
Some very carefully stabilized <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency lasers</a>, used as <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules">optical frequency standards</a> in <a href="frequency_metrology.html" title="the field of technology dealing with precise frequency measurements">frequency metrology</a>, exhibit an extremely high temporal coherence, associated with a <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> below 1&thinsp;Hz (to be compared with the mean frequency of hundreds of terahertz).
Most other lasers have a temporal coherence which is lower by many orders of magnitude.
The largest optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> is reached by some few-cycle <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked</a> <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers</a> (see also: <a href="ultrafast_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting ultrashort pulses"><em>ultrafast lasers</em></a>), emitting octave-spanning spectra.
Looking at this huge bandwidth, one might believe that such lasers have an extremely low level of temporal coherence &ndash; comparable with that of a light bulb.
This, however, is not true; the issue has been discussed in an <a href="spotlight_2006_09_22.html">earlier Spotlight article</a>.
Essentially, one has to consider that the spectrum (viewed with sufficiently high spectral resolution) forms a <a href="frequency_combs.html" title="optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines">frequency comb</a>, consisting of very narrow equidistant lines.
So we see not only that lasers exhibit very different levels of temporal coherence, but also that one misses essential aspects when trying to quantify the temporal coherence with a single number such as a <a href="coherence_length.html" title="a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the propagation distance over which the coherence significantly decays">coherence length</a> or optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.</p>
<p>As a final remark, optical processes and certain techniques are called coherent or incoherent, depending on whether they are sensitive to (relative) optical phases.
This is really a black-and-white issue.
For example, <a href="coherent_beam_combining.html" title="a class of methods for beam combining, requiring mutual coherence of the combined beams">coherent beam combining</a> works only with interferometric stability of mutual phase relations, whereas <a href="spectral_beam_combining.html" title="a class of methods for beam combining, based on wavelength-sensitive beam combiners">spectral beam combining</a> is not sensitive to such phases, as it exploits differences in optical frequency.</p>
