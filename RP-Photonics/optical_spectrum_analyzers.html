<p>Optical spectrum analyzers (OSA) are precision instruments which are used for measuring <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectra</a>, based on which a further analysis is often possible.
Some typical applications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>characterization of light sources such as <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> and <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light emitting diodes</a> (LEDs)</li>
<li>testing of optical systems, for example <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain">wavelength division multiplexing</a> systems in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> networks, where one may need to test the optical powers of the different wavelength channels and measure <a href="signal_to_noise_ratio.html" title="the ratio of signal power to noise power in a detector">signal-to-noise ratios</a>.</li>
<li>measurements of the wavelength-dependent <a href="transmissivity.html" title="the ratio of transmitted optical power to the incident optical power at a surface">transmissivity</a> or <a href="reflectivity.html" title="the ratio of reflected optical power to the incident optical power at a surface">reflectivity</a> of optical systems or devices by comparing spectra with and without the device</li>
<li>characterization of <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> (e.g. telecom <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a>) in terms of wavelength-dependent <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and <a href="noise_figure.html" title="a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="togglediv">Specialized and All-purpose Spectrum Analyzers</h2>
<div>
<p>Some spectrum analyzers are specialized for certain applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are devices for use in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical communications</a>, which are restricted to one or more <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">telecom wavelength bands</a> (e.g. the C band, or the full range from 1250 to 1700&nbsp;nm).</li>
<li>Some high-resolution spectrum analyzers are made for specific applications in <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a>, for example in <a href="raman_spectroscopy.html" title="optical spectroscopy based on spontaneous or stimulated Raman scattering">Raman spectroscopy</a> and <a href="fluorescence_spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy which is based on the analysis of fluorescence light">fluorescence spectroscopy</a>.
Some of them work far in the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region.</li>
<li>Other instruments are made for application mainly with visible light, for example spanning the wavelength range from 400 to 1000&nbsp;nm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other spectrum analyzers are versatile laboratory instruments; such equipment can offer many features:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Universal spectrum analyzers, offering great flexibility in terms of wavelength ranges, resolution, sensitivity settings etc., are versatile laboratory instruments.</aside>
<ul>
<li>They can cover wide wavelength ranges, possibly using different <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a>.</li>
<li>They often offer a variable wavelength resolution (RBW = resolution bandwidth), e.g. between 0.1&nbsp;nm and 5&nbsp;nm.</li>
<li>The sweep rate can automatically be determined based on the width of the scanned wavelength range, the resolution and possibly an additional sensitivity setting.</li>
<li>A spectrum analyzer may either take single wavelength sweeps, e.g. every time when receiving some external trigger signal, or continuously take sweeps, updating the display regularly (e.g. with a rolling average).</li>
<li>The operation parameters of an analyzer are set with controls on a front panel.
There may be the option to save device settings in order to retrieve them with a single button.</li>
<li>There is normally a built-in digital display, where different display modes can be chosen &ndash; for example, a linear or logarithmic scale for the power spectral density (see below).</li>
<li>An interface of an OSA to a computer, e.g. via a USB, GPIB or network connection, can also be useful.
One can transfer your the measured spectra to a computer in order to store, process and display them there.
Also, one may automate measurements through a computer which may also control other devices.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Stand-alone and Computer-connected Instruments</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout green">Use a stand-alone instrument or one working with a lab computer?</aside>
<p>In some cases, the instrument control and display is done on the computer only, e.g. on a regular personal computer.
Such products can be substantially cheaper, even when counting the additional cost for a computer.
That kind of solution can be fully appropriate for stationary setups in a laboratory, where one may profit from a large computer screen and the potentially nice handling through a refined control software.
Where a mobile device is needed, e.g. for use in the field, a stand-alone instrument is usually more appropriate.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Input</h2>
<div>
<p>The input light may be injected into different ways, depending on the source to be analyzed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many optical spectrum analyzers have a fiber-optic input, usually with some kind of <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connector</a> (e.g. PC/PC, SC or ST) for attaching a <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber patch cable</a>.
Depending on the device, one may use cables with <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> or <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, sometimes even with <a href="fiber_bundles.html" title="bundles of optical fibers">fiber bundles</a>.</li>
<li>In other cases, there is a free-space optical input.
One typically needs to focus the input light to an <a href="optical_slits.html" title="narrow openings through which light can be transmitted">optical slit</a>, with the beam direction roughly perpendicular to the slit surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fiber inputs are often the more convenient solution.
The spectrum analyzer may then not occupy valuable space on an <a href="optical_tables.html" title="platforms for building optical devices with suppression of vibrations">optical table</a>; it may be placed in some shelf or in a mobile rack.
This type of instrument is particularly appropriate in application areas where the light is already sent through <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>.
But, there are also cases where one can conveniently collect light with a <a href="fiber_bundles.html" title="bundles of optical fibers">fiber bundle</a>, e.g. with a large circular input aperture, where the output fibers in the analyzer may be rearranged e.g. along a line which fits to the input slit of the <a href="monochromators.html" title="optical devices which transmit only light in an adjustable small range of optical wavelengths">monochromator</a>.</p>
<p>Even for free-space optical setups, it may be convenient to <a href="fiber_launch_systems.html" title="optical systems for launching light into optical fibers">launch the light</a> into a suitable fiber in order to transport it to the spectrum analyzer.
Problems may arise when the coupling efficiency cannot be considered to be constant over the relevant spectral range, because that can obviously lead to distortions of the recorded optical spectra.
Note, however, that the same kind of problem can also occur to some extent with free-space beams.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Powers and Power Spectral Densities</h2>
<div>
<p>Theoretically, an optical spectrum should show the <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> (PSD) as a function of wavelength or optical frequency.
However, the vertical axis of the display of a spectral analyzer often displays an <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> rather than a PSD.
The latter can be obtained by dividing that power through the chosen detection bandwidth.
However, for similar reasons as with electronic spectrum analyzers, such power spectral densities may not be accurate.
The calibration is often done for quasi-<a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic light</a>.
If in addition the <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> is defined via its full width at half maximum (FWHM), it depends on the filter shape how well the power divided by the bandwidth agrees with the power spectral density.</p>
<aside class="callout red">For accurate power measurements, better use a power meter!</aside>
<p>Note that generally spectrum analyzers are not the best suited devices for optical power measurements &ndash; far less than <a href="optical_power_meters.html" title="instruments for optical power measurements, based e.g. on heating of an absorber structure or a photodiode">power meters</a>.
In many situations, one has the additional problem of not precisely known coupling efficiencies in the light delivery path.
One may externally use the total optical power, as measured with a power meter, for calibration the vertical scaling.</p>
<p>Spectrum analyzers often use a logarithmic display scale for optical powers, where one can cover a large dynamic range.
It is common to display <a href="dbm.html" title="dB relative to a reference power of 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mW">dBm</a> values, which mean <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a> relative to 1&nbsp;mW.
For example, 20&nbsp;dBm correspond to 100&nbsp;mW.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Operation Principles</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout red">There are fundamentally different operation principles!</aside>
<p>Spectrum analyzers can be based on very different operation principles, as explained in the following sections.
Some of them exploit wavelength-dependent <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> angles, while others contain some type of <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometer</a>.
The performance figures achieved with such devices can be very different.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Spectrum Analyzers Based on Diffraction Gratings</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Spectrographs</h3>
<div>
<p>Some spectrum analyzers are based on a <a href="spectrographs.html" title="instruments for spectrally analyzing light">spectrograph</a>, where <a href="polychromatic_light.html" title="light with multiple optical frequencies">polychromatic</a> light is spatially dispersed with a <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction grating</a> and then sent to some kind of multi-channel <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a>, e.g. in the form of a <a href="photodiode_arrays.html" title="typically linear arrays of photodiodes, provided as compact devices">photodiode array</a> or a one-dimensional <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">CCD sensor</a>.
With this concept, the wavelength resolution is normally determined by the used photodetector.
One may, however, use different gratings for different wavelength ranges and resolutions.</p>
<p>Spectrographs are appropriate solutions for many applications, and in particular their high acquisition speed can be quite advantageous.
However, their operation principle comes with certain limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The required spatially resolving type of photodetector can be operated only in limited wavelength regions, often not spanning much of the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> region.</li>
<li>The dynamic range is often quite limited due to incomplete suppression of stray light effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, high-performance spectrum analyzers are mostly designed as <em>scanning instruments</em> &ndash; see the following section.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Scanning Instruments</h3>
<div>
<p>In a scanning spectrum analyzer (see Figure&nbsp;1), the input light is sent through a tunable bandpass filter, and a single high-dynamic-range <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> detects the transmitted <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
The control electronics systematically tune the transmission wavelength through the requested wavelength range in order to record the transmitted power as a function of the wavelength.
The results are then displayed on a digital screen &ndash; either a screen in the front panel of the analyzer or the screen of a connected computer.
The wavelength resolution is determined by the monochromator.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The tunable bandpass filter (<a href="monochromators.html" title="optical devices which transmit only light in an adjustable small range of optical wavelengths">monochromator</a>) is usually realized based on one or more <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a>.
For example, one may use a monochromator of Czerny&ndash;Turner type, or two such devices in a sequence in order to achieve a steeper filter function, so that influences of a strong signal at one wavelength on the readings at other wavelengths (e.g. through stray light) are minimized.
The selected wavelength can then be tuned by rotating the grating(s) with a precise kind of electric motor.
One may also have several gratings mounted on one rotating disk, so that gratings with different line spacings can be used for different spectral resolutions, or gratings which are optimized for different spectral regions.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Precise optical-mechanics are required for grating-based spectrum analyzers.</aside>
<p>The motorized <a href="opto_mechanics.html" title="mechanical elements used in optics">opto-mechanical</a> drive for the rotation of the grating should be reasonably fast but also needs to be highly precise: it should not only be able to rotate the grating in very fine steps, but also to reproduce any position with high accuracy.
Some deviations via aging or mechanical shocks may be compensated through software with occasional calibration runs, using some kind of <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules">optical frequency standards</a>.</p>
<p>The wavelength resolution can be modified via the <a href="optical_slits.html" title="narrow openings through which light can be transmitted">slit</a> width of the monochromator, or possibly by using a a grating with different line spacing.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The dynamic range is limited by the quality of the monochromator.</aside>
<p>If a simple type of <a href="monochromators.html" title="optical devices which transmit only light in an adjustable small range of optical wavelengths">monochromator</a> is used, the dynamic range may be limited to the order of 30&nbsp;dB &ndash; much less than the photodetector could typically provide.
This is essentially because strong light at one wavelength can influence the readings at other wavelengths through stray light within the monochromator.
Therefore, one often uses a dual-monochromator setup with two monochromators in series, which always need to be precisely tuned to the same wavelength.
That way, one can achieve a dynamic range of more than 70&nbsp;dB.
Alternatively, one may employ a double pass through one monochromator, reaching a cheaper and more compact setup, but tentatively with a smaller dynamic range.</p>
<p>The duration for each wavelength sweep will typically be increased when requesting a higher wavelength resolution, and may be increased further when requesting an increased sensitivity by allowing more time per wavelength bin.
In the latter case, the averaging of detector signals over a longer time (i.e., applying a lower video bandwidth) reduces the impact of noise.
It is actually one of the differences in comparison to electronic spectrum analyzers that the time required per data point is not limited by the settling time of the bandpass filter but by noise averaging considerations, if not by opto-mechanical limitations.</p>
<p>For particularly high sensitivity, some devices use a chopper mode.
Here, the optical input signal is modulated with an <a href="optical_choppers.html" title="devices for periodically interrupting light beams">optical chopper</a>, and one uses lock-in detection.
That way, the influence of low-frequency noise of the photodetector can be substantially reduced at the expense of longer measurement times.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Be careful with time-dependent input signals!</aside>
<p>The principle of a scanning spectrum analyzer is based on the assumption that the properties of the light input remain approximately constant during the sweep time.
That may well be the case for a <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> laser, for example, but not for a <a href="pulsed_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting light in the form of pulses">pulsed laser</a>, for which such an instrument may be completely unusable.
For very high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a>, as obtained from <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>, that problem usually does not arise.</p>
<p>Some devices can also be operated with a constant setting of the grating filter, so that one simply measures the power at one particular wavelength.</p>
<p>When a diffraction grating is used for wavelength discrimination, that may introduce a <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a> dependence.
It is possible, however, to obtain polarization-independent operation, e.g. by using a dual-monochromator or double-pass setup where the polarization state is rotated by 90&deg; between the two stages or passes.</p>
<p>Mainly due to the required precise <a href="opto_mechanics.html" title="mechanical elements used in optics">opto-mechanics</a>, such precision instruments should be handled with great care.
They may occasionally require some service, e.g. for accurate wavelength recalibration.
Instruments may also have of a more or less convenient calibration procedures to be performed by the users themselves, possibly requiring some accurate wavelength standards.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Spectrum Analyzers Based on Fabry&ndash;P&eacute;rot Interferometers</h2>
<div>
<p>A particularly fine wavelength resolution can be achieved by using a <a href="fabry_perot_interferometers.html" title="interferometers consisting of two highly reflecting mirrors, forming a standing-wave resonator">Fabry&ndash;P&eacute;rot interferometer</a> as wavelength-tunable bandpass filter.
Here, one uses the high transmission at resonances, which can be tuned through fine adjustment of the resonator length with a piezo transducer.
One may either use a true Fabry&ndash;P&eacute;rot with flat mirrors, where higher-order modes have about the same resonance frequencies as the fundamental mode, and no mode matching is required, or a resonator with curved mirrors with mode matching to the fundamental modes (which is compatible with light delivery through a single-mode fiber).
Another approach not requiring mode matching is to use a confocal resonator design, where the transverse mode spacing is half the free spectral range.</p>
<p>A fundamental limitation of Fabry&ndash;P&eacute;rots is that they have a quite limited <a href="free_spectral_range.html" title="frequency spacing of the axial modes of an optical resonator">free spectral range</a>.
Therefore, such devices are not suitable as universal optical spectrum analyzers, but only for specific high-precision applications where high resolution in a narrow wavelength range is required.
For example, one may use such instruments in telecom applications for tracking the optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of signals; the higher that bandwidth, the more susceptible they are to effects of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>.</p>
<p>As a numerical example, an air-spaced Fabry&ndash;P&eacute;rot with a narrow distance of 10&nbsp;mm is a free spectral range of &approx;15&nbsp;GHz.
If its <a href="finesse.html" title="the free spectral range divided by the FWHM width of the resonances of an optical resonator">finesse</a> is 1000, for example, the frequency resolution is 15&nbsp;MHz.
That is far better than achievable with other types of spectrum analyzers as described in this article.
One may also get a larger free spectral range with a more compact cavity, but for a given finesse that deteriorates the frequency resolution at the same time.
Note that a much higher finesse is in principle possible by using <a href="supermirrors.html" title="laser mirrors with a very high reflectivity">supermirrors</a> with very high <a href="reflectivity.html" title="the ratio of reflected optical power to the incident optical power at a surface">reflectivity</a>, but the alignment then also becomes rather critical for designs not requiring mode matching.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Spectrum Analyzers Based on Michelson Interferometers</h2>
<div>
<p>One can also realize an optical spectrum analyzer based on a <a href="michelson_interferometers.html" title="an interferometer with two separate arms and a single beam splitter">Michelson interferometer</a> &ndash; with an operation principle (<a href="fourier_transform_spectroscopy.html" title="a method for spectroscopy rare an optical spectrum is computed from raw data with a Fourier transform"><em>Fourier transform spectroscopy</em></a>) which is completely different to that of the other principles explained above.
It does <em>not</em> involve a tunable bandpass filter.
Instead, it works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>One records the output power of the interferometer as a function of the arm length difference <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&Delta;</span><i>L</i></span>.
For a <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> light input, this would be a sinusoidal oscillation, the spatial period of which can be used to calculate the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>.
(That is the operation principle of a <a href="wavemeters.html" title="devices for precise measurements of laser wavelengths">wavemeter</a>; such devices are therefore also called <em>multi-wavelength meters</em>.)</li>
<li>The result (the function <span class="eqn_il"><i>P</i>(<span class="greek">&Delta;</span><i>L</i>)</span>, which can be interpreted as the interferometric <a href="autocorrelators.html" title="devices for measuring the intensity or field autocorrelation function of light, mostly used for determining the duration of ultrashort pulses">autocorrelation</a> function) is subject to a Fourier transform, using an FFT algorithm with a microprocessor.
With appropriate scaling, that delivers the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> of the light input.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to understand the relation between the scan and photodetector parameters and the performance parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The highest detectable <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a> (smallest optical wavelength) is limited not only by the used photodetector, but also by the spatial resolution of the measurement of <span class="eqn_il"><i>P</i>(<span class="greek">&Delta;</span><i>L</i>)</span>.
One should have more than two data points per oscillation cycle.</li>
<li>The longest detectable wavelength is only limited by the photodetector (or possibly by the optics).</li>
<li>The wavelength resolution is limited by the range of arm length differences which is scanned in the measurement.
More specifically, the frequency resolution is of the order of the <a href="velocity_of_light.html" title="the velocity with which light propagates in a medium">velocity of light</a> divided by twice the range of arm length differences.
For example, if one scans over 15&nbsp;mm, the frequency resolution is of the order of 10&nbsp;GHz, which at a wavelength of 1&nbsp;&mu;m (for example) corresponds to &approx;0.03&nbsp;nm.
The simplest relation is actually obtained for the spectroscopic <a href="wavenumber.html" title="the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumber</a> (inverse wavelength): the wavenumber resolution is simply the inverse of the range of path length differences.
For the Michelson interferometer, the latter is twice the range of arm length differences.
In our example case, the wavenumber resolution would be 1 / (2 &middot; 1.5&nbsp;cm) &approx; 0.33&nbsp;cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For obtaining the autocorrelation function with a sufficiently high accuracy, one simultaneously also records the same for a <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">frequency-stabilized</a> reference laser (with only slightly displayed beam paths).
It is then not even necessary to guarantee a precisely linear movement; software can retrieve the autocorrelation function by comparing the interference fringes from the observed light to those of the reference laser.
Therefore, one may even use a simple kind of voice coil motor, which would not be suitable for accurately reaching and holding a certain position, for example.
It is only essential to maintain an accurate alignment, ensuring that the two interferograms are precisely related to each other.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The dynamic range is quite limited!</aside>
<p>While the Fourier transform measurement principle allows one to cover a large wavelength range with quite high resolution, it is quite limited in terms of dynamic range and sensitivity.
This is because of its noise properties.
For example, a strong monochromatic optical input signal will not precisely result in a sinusoidal oscillation of the recorded signal; due to <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a> of the signal or due to noise from the photodetector and electronics, some broad background of the obtained spectrum is generated, which limits the sensitivity to weak signals at other wavelengths.
Interestingly, the sensitivity thus gets worse in the presence of other strong signals.
Therefore, we need to understand that dynamic range as the ratio of two optical powers: that of a strong signal divided by that of a weak, still detectable signal at another wavelength.
A weak signal alone would be less of a challenge.</p>
<p>The typically achievable dynamic range with such systems of the order of 30 to 40&nbsp;dB.
That is sufficient for some applications, but not for others.</p>
<p>The explained problem can also not be solved by increasing the wavelength resolution via a longer scan range.
Therefore, such a spectrum analyzer would hardly be suitable for <a href="raman_spectroscopy.html" title="optical spectroscopy based on spontaneous or stimulated Raman scattering">Raman spectroscopy</a>, for example, unless one could effectively filter out the laser light before entering the spectrum analyzer.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Important Performance Figures of Optical Spectrum Analyzers</h2>
<div>
<p>Although various aspects have already been mentioned above, the most important performance figures are briefly described in the following:</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Wavelength Range</h3>
<div>
<p>Every spectrum analyzer is limited to a certain range of optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a>.
In some cases, one cannot access the full wavelength range in a single spectrum, since a diffraction grating or the photodetector needs to be replaced, for example.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Wavelength Resolution and Filter Shape</h3>
<div>
<p>The wavelength resolution can be a fixed value for simple spectrum analyzers, while for other instruments it can be modified.</p>
<p>Universal optical spectrum analyzers (normally based on gratings) often offer wavelength resolutions e.g. between 0.1&nbsp;nm and 5&nbsp;nm.
High-performance devices even reach the order of 0.01&nbsp;nm (= 10&nbsp;pm) resolution.
Measurements with low wavelength resolution can be sensible for increased acquisition speed, for example.</p>
<p>Not only the wavelength resolution in terms of a full width at half maximum is important, but also the filter shape &ndash; in particular, how steeply and how far the filter function drops with increasing wavelength offset.
That may also influence the dynamic range (see below).</p>
<p>Specialized high-resolution spectrum analyzers, for example those based on <a href="fabry_perot_interferometers.html" title="interferometers consisting of two highly reflecting mirrors, forming a standing-wave resonator">Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometers</a>, may offer much higher wavelength resolution, but only in a very restricted wavelength range because of their small <a href="free_spectral_range.html" title="frequency spacing of the axial modes of an optical resonator">free spectral range</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Wavelength Accuracy</h3>
<div>
<p>Wavelength resolution should not be confused with wavelength accuracy.
For example, an instrument which has long been used in a rough environment may have lost its wavelength calibration, so that wavelength determinations are consistently wrong by some amount.
Some instruments can be recalibrated even by the user, if suitable <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules">optical frequency standards</a> are available.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Dynamic Range and Sensitivity</h3>
<div>
<p>Instruments have a limited dynamic range, i.e., a limited range of <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> or <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral densities</a>.
That limit is not necessarily set by the used <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a>.
It can also arise from the problem that an intense wavelength component can influence the readings at other wavelengths, e.g. by <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattering</a> of light within a grating <a href="monochromators.html" title="optical devices which transmit only light in an adjustable small range of optical wavelengths">monochromator</a> or via noise issues in an interferometric spectrum analyzer.
Therefore, a dynamic range and sensitivity specifications may refer to different limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may simply indicate the minimum amount of optical input power which can be reasonably well detected (e.g. a couple of <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a> above the noise level).</li>
<li>It may indicate how much weaker a detectable weak signal may be compared with another strong signal.
That quantity may also depend on the wavelength separation between the two signals.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a maximum optical input power which the device can tolerate without being damaged.
Some spectrum analyzers have an optional input <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam">attenuator</a>, which one can use for operation at higher power levels.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Power Accuracy</h3>
<div>
<p>As mentioned above, optical spectrum analyzers are often not particularly accurate for measurements of optical power.
Some instruments, however, can be expected to have a reasonable calibration &ndash; in particular, fiber-coupled devices for use with a single-mode fibers.
For example, in an <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> network one may need to accurately determine channel powers.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Acquisition Speed</h3>
<div>
<p>Particularly for scanning instruments, acquisition speed can be an important factor.
It often substantially depends on the chosen device settings concerning wavelength range, wavelength resolution and sensitivity.
For a fair comparison between different devices, such settings need to be considered.</p>
