<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>, <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a>, <a href="rgb_sources.html" title="source of red, green and blue light, which is usually provided in the form laser beams">RGB sources</a>; F. Brunner et al., Opt. Lett. 29 (16), 1921 (2004); S. Favre et al., IEEE J. Quantum Electron. 39 (6), 733 (2003)</p>
<p>It is often claimed that shorter optical pulses allow to obtain more efficient <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>, such as <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a> in some <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal material</a>.
This may or may not be true, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>A shorter <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> for a given <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a> means a higher <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a>.
In situations where one is short of peak power, this may then help.
For example, consider frequency doubling in a <a href="critical_phase_matching.html" title="phase matching of a nonlinear interaction by adjustment of a propagation direction">critically phase-matched</a> crystal.
Due to the <a href="spatial_walk_off.html" title="the phenomenon that the intensity distribution of a beam in an anisotropic crystal drifts away from the direction of the wave vector">spatial walk-off</a>, the pump <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> can not be made very small, and this effect often sets a much tighter limit to focusing than e.g. the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>.
As a result, one can achieve sufficiently high optical intensities for efficient nonlinear conversion only for high enough peak power, which is easier to obtain with shorter pulses.
As an example, take the reference given above (Brunner 2004): the reported <a href="rgb_sources.html" title="source of red, green and blue light, which is usually provided in the form laser beams">RGB source</a> was based on a <a href="passive_mode_locking.html" title="a technique of mode locking, based on a saturable absorber inside the laser resonator">passively mode-locked</a> <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin disk laser</a>, which generated sub-picosecond pulses, and only with that short pulse duration it was possible to use critical phase matching at room temperature for all nonlinear conversion stages except one.
Longer pulses, as could be generated e.g. with some <a href="picosecond_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting pulses with picosecond durations">picosecond</a> <a href="vanadate_lasers.html" title="lasers based on rare-earth-doped yttrium, gadolinium or lutetium vanadate crystals, usually Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>">vanadate laser</a>, would have required <a href="noncritical_phase_matching.html" title="a technique of phase matching which does not require a critical angular adjustment">noncritical phase matching</a>, so that several temperature-stabilized <a href="crystal_ovens.html" title="temperature-controlled ovens for keeping optical crystals at the desired operation temperature">crystal ovens</a> would have to be used &ndash; with obvious implications for any practical use.</p>
<p>Another aspect which in principle favors shorter pulses is that the damage threshold of nonlinear crystals in terms of optical intensity (not fluence) normally gets higher for shorter pulses.
However, this aspect can normally become relevant only for very long pulse durations in the microsecond regime (Favre 2003).</p>
<p>For nonlinear conversion at shorter wavelengths, ultrashort (femtosecond) pulses can introduce significant difficulties.
The point is that <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and thus the <a href="group_velocity_mismatch.html" title="the phenomenon that pulses become temporally separated in a medium due to different group velocities, or (quantitatively) the difference of inverse group velocities">group velocity mismatch</a> becomes strong at short wavelengths.
This means that shorter pulses require shorter nonlinear crystals.
To maintain a high conversion efficiency, one then has to increase the peak intensity.
While high intensities are easy to achieve for short pulses, these intensities are exactly what nonlinear crystals usually don't like at short wavelengths: <a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">two-photon absorption</a> and other effects can cause crystal degradation (<a href="photodarkening.html" title="the phenomenon that the optical power losses in a medium can grow when the medium is irradiated with light at certain wavelengths">photodarkening</a>) and even catastrophic damage.
Possible remedies are <a href="resonant_frequency_doubling.html" title="frequency doubling with a nonlinear crystal placed in a resonant enhancement cavity">resonant frequency doubling</a> or schemes with multiple nonlinear crystals and compensation of group velocity mismatch with additional <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringent</a> crystals in between.
Such approaches, however, make the system overall more complex and expensive.
The simple solution is to use larger beam areas, but this reduces the conversion efficiency.</p>
<p>The discussion shows that a comprehensive understanding of a number of issues is essential to design a nonlinear conversion stage with high conversion efficiency and long lifetime.
For example, a crystal material with higher damage threshold may not lead to a better combination of efficiency and lifetime, if it has a lower nonlinearity or less suitable dispersive properties.
There are different parameter regimes, where different effects are limiting the achievable performance.
For the choice of the best suited material, a figure-of-merit has to be used depending on the operation regime.</p>
