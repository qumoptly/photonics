<aside class="callout green">What exactly is photonics?</aside>
<p>Photonics is the science and technology of light, with an emphasis on applications: harnessing light in a wide range of fields.
This term <em>photonics</em> was coined by the French physicist Pierre Aigrain in 1967 and is widely used since the mid-1970s.
An alternative term is <em>lightwave technology</em>.
There is also the term <em>photon science</em>, which relates to the scientific part of photonics.</p>
<p>Light (high-frequency electromagnetic radiation) obviously plays the central role in photonics.
The used light encompasses not only visible, but also <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> and <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> light.</p>
<p>At the heart of photonics are technologies for generating light (e.g. with <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> or with <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diodes</a>), transmitting, <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifying</a>, <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">modulating</a>, <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">detecting</a> and analyzing light (e.g. with <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a>), and particularly using light for various practical purposes.
It thus builds heavily on optical technology (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="optics.html" title="the science and technology dealing with the properties and the propagation of light">optics</a>), supplemented with modern developments such as <a href="optoelectronics.html" title="the technology of electronic devices that interact with light">optoelectronics</a> (mostly involving semiconductors), laser systems, <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">optical amplifiers</a> and novel materials (e.g. <a href="photonic_metamaterials.html" title="nanostructured materials with special optical properties">photonic metamaterials</a>).
The scientific basis is mostly within physics, in particular optical physics and related areas such as <a href="laser_physics.html" title="the field of physics dealing with phenomena in lasers">laser physics</a> and <a href="quantum_optics.html" title="the part of optics which deals with quantum effects">quantum optics</a>.</p>
<p>Typical application areas of photonics are</p>
<aside class="callout green">What is photonics used for? For which technology area is it relevant?</aside>
<ul>
<li>information technology: e.g. <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> for fast internet access, <a href="free_space_optical_communications.html" title="optical data transmission through free space, usually through air or vacuum">free-space optical communications</a>, <a href="quantum_cryptography.html" title="methods to encrypt information securely, relying on quantum-mechanical phenomena">quantum cryptography</a> and optical data storage, in the future probably also optical computing; partly, one uses techniques of <a href="quantum_photonics.html" title="the science and technology using quantum optics for applications like quantum communications, quantum computing and quantum metrology">quantum photonics</a></li>
<li>health care and life sciences (biophotonics): e.g. medical diagnostics and therapy in ophthalmology, infection sciences and cancer research; biology, biotechnology, DNA analysis, genome mapping</li>

</ul>
<p>Photonic key technologies of particular importance are <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> and <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a> systems, <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diodes</a> (LEDs), optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> and other <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a>, <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulators</a>, <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> (including cameras), and displays.</p>
<p>There is an analogy with electronics: just as electronics is the utilization of electrons, photonics works on the basis of <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>.
The <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum</a> (<a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a>) nature of light is often, but by far not always of interest in photonics; there is the more specific area of <a href="quantum_photonics.html" title="the science and technology using quantum optics for applications like quantum communications, quantum computing and quantum metrology">quantum photonics</a>.
This is important for secure communications, and in the future possibly also for quantum computing.
A substantial amount of scientific research is still required to enable such advanced applications.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Importance of Photonics</h2>
<div>
<p>Photonics is considered as one of the key technologies of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
It supplements electronics in the form of <a href="optoelectronics.html" title="the technology of electronic devices that interact with light">optoelectronics</a> (optronics) and exhibits a strong market growth, which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
So far, photonics has achieved a deep penetration of mass markets and correspondingly large sales volumes in only a few areas, e.g. <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> in CD/DVD players and related technics of optical data storage.
Huge growth opportunities are expected from the development of <a href="silicon_photonics.html" title="photonic technology based on silicon chips">silicon photonics</a> and other technologies for <a href="photonic_integrated_circuits.html" title="integrated circuits with optical functions">photonic integrated circuits</a>, from <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">LEDs</a> with improved output power and efficiency, or from laser types (e.g. <a href="vertical_external_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="surface-emitting semiconductor lasers with an external laser resonator">VECSELs</a>) which are suitable for cost-effective mass production.</p>
<p>Various government institutions, including agencies for research funding, have recognized the enormous importance of photonics for science, technology and the whole economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is the European technology platform <a href="https://www.photonics21.org/" rel="nofollow">Photonics21</a>, which implements a common photonics strategy in the Horizon2020 Public Private Partnership and is expected to have substantial effects on job creation.
Many hundreds of million euros per year support photonics research programs in Europe.</li>
<li>In the United States, the <a href="https://www.lightourfuture.org/" rel="nofollow">National Photonics Initiative</a> (NPI) tries to increase collaboration and coordination among the U.S. industry, government and academia, and to identify particularly important areas of photonics which are critical for competitiveness and national security.
The report <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/get_involved/public_policy/national_photonics_initiative/harnessing_light/" rel="nofollow">Harnessing Light</a> of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Light committee has found a lot of attention by analyzing the current state of optical sciences and suggested goals for future developments.</li>
<li>China, Japan and South Korea are also investing enormous resources into photonics research.
For example, the new Science and  Technology (S&amp;T) plan of China does a lot for photonics research and development; of the order of 1 billion euros per year are currently invested into photonics R&thinsp;&amp;&thinsp;D in China.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Nobel Prizes in Photonics</h2>
<div>

</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Influence of Cost of Market Penetration</h2>
<div>
<p>In many application areas, the progress for market penetration of photonics products is hindered by the problem of high cost.
For example, <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> are in most cases rather expensive devices, even when based on not particularly complex technology.
The main reasons for that are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the short <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> of light, optical components often need to be aligned very precisely.
Therefore, highly precise <a href="opto_mechanics.html" title="mechanical elements used in optics">opto-mechanics</a> are required, and the alignment procedures can be difficult and time-consuming, as far as they cannot be automated.</li>
<li>Although alignment processes can often be avoided by using <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a> instead of free-space optics, <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a> connections are also much more delicate than most electrical connections.</li>
<li>Generally, optical setups are highly sensitive to dust, dirt and scratches, so that they need to be made in a very clean environment and handled with great care.
(This is also largely due to the short optical wavelengths.)</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout red">High fabrication cost prohibits large production numbers, while small production numbers prohibit the use of efficient mass production!</aside>
<ul>
<li>Due to the small production numbers, most <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> and photonic instruments (e.g. <a href="optical_spectrum_analyzers.html" title="instruments for measuring optical spectra">optical spectrum analyzers</a>) are fabricated in ways which require substantial amounts of labor.
Efficient production methods, as used for example for cars or for electronics, are so far not widely used, because the high initial investment would be worthwhile only for larger production numbers &ndash; which however are still hindered by the current product cost.</li>
<li>Even though the total production numbers of lasers, for example, have become quite substantial, they are spread over a huge number of different models &ndash; not only because they are made by numerous manufacturers, but also because a substantial number of operation parameters has to be adapted to specific applications, having very different requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more effective solutions are found for those problems, the better are the chances for further economical growth of the photonic sector.
For example, <a href="vertical_external_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="surface-emitting semiconductor lasers with an external laser resonator">VECSEL</a> technology could lead to substantially cheaper replacements for many traditional <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> (mostly for <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a>), and <a href="silicon_photonics.html" title="photonic technology based on silicon chips">silicon photonics</a> could find a lot of applications in mass markets (particularly in information technology) with strong cost pressure.</p>

<h2>Numerical Modeling</h2>
<p>Developing devices or systems in photonics requires a <b>comprehensive quantitative understanding</b> &ndash; otherwise, it becomes inefficient, waisting time and money.</p>
<p><a href="./laser_modeling.html?banner=numerical_modeling">Numerical modeling</a> is often the most efficient way towards results:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand <em>quantitatively</em> what is going on</li>
<li>check the influence of design changes or possible detrimental effects</li>
<li>understand strange experimental observations</li>
<li>find optimized designs more reliably and faster</li>
</ul>
