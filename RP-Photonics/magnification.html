<p>In the context of optical <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a>, the term <em>magnification</em> generally means that the size of a displayed or directly observed image is increased (or more generally, that it is modified).
However, it depends on the circumstances what in detail that means.</p>
<p>Generally, one distinguishes between <em>linear magnification</em> (also <em>transverse</em> or <em>lateral magnification</em>) M, which relates to dimensions of some images, and <em>angular magnification</em> MA, where viewing angles are considered.
For a <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescope</a>, understood as an <a href="afocal_optical_systems.html" title="optical systems which output parallel rays for parallel input rays">afocal</a> system, the angular magnification factor is the inverse of the linear magnification factor (assuming equal refractive indices on both sides of the optics).</p>
<p>Further, one can define the <em>longitudinal magnification</em>, which tells how much the image position changes (differentially) for changes of the object position.</p>
<p>The term <em>amplification</em> is not only used for the phenomenon as large, but frequently also as a short form for <em>amplification factor</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the term <em>power</em> is used instead of <em>magnification</em> e.g. of a telescope.</p>
<p>In case of magnification factors smaller than unity, the term <em>demagnification</em> is often used.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Magnification of Photographs</h2>
<div>
<p>Photography can involve two or more imaging steps.
In a first step, some objects are imaged to a photographic film or an <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensor</a>, for example.
In most cases, those images are smaller than the objects; we have a magnification below unity.</p>
<p>In a second step, enlarged images can be produced &ndash; for example, one can produce images of postcard size from smaller film negatives, applying some magnification about unity.
With larger magnification, one can make posters.
Also, one may produce slide positives and project them to a large screen, or display digital images on large screens.</p>
<p>In all those cases, one is dealing with linear magnification.</p>
<p>See also the article on <a href="imaging_with_a_lens.html" title="creation of an optical image using a single lens">imaging with a lens</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Magnification of a Telescope</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">The angular magnification is what is relevant for a telescope.</aside>
<p>The situation with an optical <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescope</a> for direct viewing is profoundly different.
The objects are usually placed at a large distance from the telescope <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objective</a>, and the light coming from different objects to the telescope is essentially distinguished via slightly different angular propagation directions.
In <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">geometrical optics</a>, we are dealing with light rays having slightly different angular directions.
In the basic configuration of a telescope, parallel incoming rays are converted into parallel rays at the output of the <a href="ocular_lenses.html" title="lenses or lens systems as used in telescopes and microscopes, for example, close to the observing eye">ocular lens</a> (eyepiece), and only in the optical system of the observing eye they are focused to the retina, where one would ideally obtain one image point for each angular direction.</p>
<p>One can see that the essential optical function of the telescope is to provide some <em>angular magnification</em>, so that effectively the image on the retina will be enlarged compared with direct viewing (without the telescope).</p>
<p>See the article on <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescopes</a> for more details, for example the contributions of <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objective</a> and <a href="ocular_lenses.html" title="lenses or lens systems as used in telescopes and microscopes, for example, close to the observing eye">ocular lens</a> to the magnification.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Magnification of a Loupe or a Magnifying Glass</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout red">It can depend on various assumptions what magnification is calculated!</aside>
<p>The magnification of a <a href="loupes.html" title="optical lenses held close to the eye which are used for viewing objects with some moderate magnification">loupe</a> is somewhat more difficult to analyze.
Here, we cannot simply compare linear dimensions or angular separations between the input and output.
One needs to consider the system consisting of the loupe and the human eye, and compare that to the human eye alone.
In the latter case, one assumes a standard distance of 250&nbsp;mm, to which the healthy eye can easily accommodate in order to resolve details most accurately.
The obtained magnification then depends on whether during use of the loupe the eye is relaxed (focused to infinite distance) or focused to a smaller distance; in the latter case, the spacing between eye and loupe is also relevant, and a somewhat larger magnification can be achieved.</p>
<p>For <a href="magnifying_glasses.html" title="optical lenses held above objects for viewing them with some moderate magnification">magnifying glasses</a>, which are typically held in a larger distance from the eye and have a larger <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a>, the situation is again somewhat different.</p>
<p>See the articles on <a href="loupes.html" title="optical lenses held close to the eye which are used for viewing objects with some moderate magnification">loupes</a> and <a href="magnifying_glasses.html" title="optical lenses held above objects for viewing them with some moderate magnification">magnifying glasses</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Magnification of a Microscope</h2>
<div>
<p>The magnification of a <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscope</a> is determined in a similar way as for the loupe.
Essentially, one compares the perceived image size between two situations: for observation through the microscope and for direct viewing without that instrument &ndash; in the latter case, again in a standard distance of 250&nbsp;mm.
The resulting magnifications are normally between 20 and 1000.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Useful and Empty Magnification</h2>
<div>
<p>In principle, arbitrary amounts of image amplification could be achieved e.g. by cascading magnifying optical instruments.
However, magnification is only useful to some extent.
For example, consider the use of a <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscope</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The microscope's magnification is considered as useful (or usable) as long as it allows one to see more details of objects.
In a situation where the achieved resolution is still limited by the resolution of the observing eye, a higher magnification would still be useful.</li>
<li>Beyond that point, however, magnification becomes &ldquo;empty&rdquo;: although the obtained images get larger, they do not resolve more details, because the resolution is limited by <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> or by imperfections of the optical instrument, for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same situation is encountered when viewing digital images on a screen.
Once an image is displayed in a size where each image pixel corresponds to at least one screen pixel, the whole available image information is displayed.
Further increases of magnification may only be useful if the observer has difficulties resolving the screen pixels.</p>
