<p>Various kinds of materials are used for making optical elements.
Optical materials are usually understood to be transparent materials, i.e., materials with good light transmission in some spectral ranges, exhibiting little <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> and <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattering</a> of light.
However, absorption can be utilized for <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filters</a>, and even light scattering is utilized in some applications.
Furthermore, some materials are useful for making optical components which do not transmit light; for example, some materials with full transparency can be used as <a href="mirror_substrates.html" title="substrates on which coatings for laser mirrors can be deposited">substrates</a> for <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, different classes of optical materials are described, and their most important properties are explained.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Inorganic Glasses</h2>
<div>
<p>The mostly used optical materials are <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">optical glasses</a> made of inorganic compounds, containing chemical species like silicon, oxygen, sodium, aluminum, germanium, boron and lead.</p>
<p>Only in few cases, one uses pure materials with very few chemical constituents; the most prominent example is fused silica glass (silicon dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>), which is widely used for bulk optics.
It is also used in the form of <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>; here, however, the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> is usually doped with some other material, e.g. with germanium.</p>
<p>There are also many silicate glasses, where various other mineral substances are mixed with silica to obtain glasses with modified properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, sodium carbonate, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide and aluminum oxide can be added to obtain soda-lime glasses, as are common for windows.
As far as they have relatively low reflective indices and low dispersion, they are called <a href="crown_glasses.html" title="optical glasses with low chromatic dispersion and tentatively a low refractive index"><em>crown glasses</em></a>.</li>
<li>Increased <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive indexs</a>, usually coming together with increased dispersion, are obtained by adding heavier materials like barium, lead, thorium, zirconium, titanium or lanthanum (usually as oxides).
Such glasses are called <a href="flint_glasses.html" title="optical glasses with strong chromatic dispersion (low Abbe number) and tentatively a high refractive index"><em>flint glasses</em></a>.
In the early times, they mostly contained the poisonous lead; this has later largely been replaced with other metals like titanium or zirconium.</li>
<li>Borosilicate glasses exhibit much reduced thermal expansion and are therefore much more resistant against thermal shocks.</li>
<li>Aluminosilicate glasses are extensively used for glass <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, including <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a> for <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">lasers</a>.
They are relatively resistant to heat.</li>
<li>Germanosilicate glasses are also common for optical fibers, particularly for <a href="telecom_fibers.html" title="optical fibers for use in optical fiber communications">telecom fibers</a>, exhibiting very low <a href="propagation_losses.html" title="losses of optical energy during propagation of light">propagation losses</a>.</li>
<li><a href="fluoride_glasses.html" title="glasses made from compounds of fluorine e.g. with zirconium, aluminum or indium">Fluoride glasses</a> and fluorophosphate glasses can be used as high-index low-dispersion glasses, e.g. for the construction of <a href="achromatic_optics.html" title="optical devices or setups with minimized chromatic aberrations">achromatic optics</a>.</li>
<li><a href="phosphate_glasses.html" title="certain glasses from which certain optical fibers and laser gain media can be made, for example">Phosphate glasses</a> hare used e.g. for some <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>, particularly if high <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentrations</a> are required.</li>
<li>Further additions like iron can be used to obtain <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> absorption (e.g. for heat-absorbing filters), or cerium for <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> absorption.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout red">Some optical glasses contain rather poisonous substances.</aside>
<p>Some glass types used in <a href="optics.html" title="the science and technology dealing with the properties and the propagation of light">optics</a> and <a href="photonics.html" title="the science and technology of light">photonics</a> contain poisonous substances like lead and cadmium.
Although that hardly creates hazards during use, since those substances are tightly bound in the glass, there are serious attempts to ban their use wherever possible, since it is hard to ensure that those materials are properly handled after use so that they cannot get into the environment.</p>
<p>For further details, see the article on <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">optical glasses</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Crystalline Materials</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Insulators</h3>
<div>
<p>In contrast to glasses, which are amorphous, crystalline materials exhibit a long-range microscopic order.
Most <a href="optical_crystals.html" title="crystals for optical applications, usually single crystals, often with polished end faces">crystalline optical materials</a> are monocrystalline (single crystal materials), since light scattering at interfaces between grain boundaries could be detrimental.
Optical crystals are basically always artificially grown materials.
The growth velocity is usually very small because otherwise one would not obtain a single crystal.
Therefore, crystalline optical materials tend to be more expensive than glasses or ceramics.</p>
<p>One reason to use crystals instead of glasses can be to obtain an extended spectral transmission range.
This is particularly so in the mid and far <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a>, where there is a limited choice of materials with good transparency.</p>
<p>In some cases, optical anisotropy is required, for example in the form of <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a>, which is obtained for crystalline materials with not too high crystal symmetry.
For example, <a href="polarizers.html" title="optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizers</a> and other types of polarization optics are made from calcite crystals.
Also, the <a href="pockels_effect.html" title="the phenomenon that the refractive index of a medium exhibits a modification which is proportional to the strength of an applied electric field (<em>linear electro-optic effect</em>)">Pockels effect</a>, as exploited in <a href="electro_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic modulators</a>, occurs only in crystalline materials.
Other crystal materials (but also glasses) are used in <a href="acousto_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the acousto-optic effect">acousto-optic</a> devices.</p>
<p>Further, there are various types of <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> which are crystalline insulators doped with laser-active ions (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="doped_insulator_lasers.html" title="lasers with a solid-state gain medium containing a laser-active dopant"><em>doped insulator lasers</em></a>).
Here, not only the optical properties are of interest.
It is particularly important how the laser-active ions interact with the host glass; the properties of the pump and <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transitions</a> can strongly depend on the glass type.</p>
<p>Other doped crystals are used as <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorbers</a>, e.g. for <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a> of lasers.</p>
<p>Finally, various crystal materials of low crystal symmetry are used for <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>, based on their <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&chi;</span><sup>(2)</sup></span> nonlinearity.</p>
<p><a href="optical_crystals.html" title="crystals for optical applications, usually single crystals, often with polished end faces">Optical crystals</a>, particularly those without special dopants, are highly pure materials with very consistent optical properties &ndash; in contrast to glasses, where the exact composition of the used raw materials may somewhat vary, and there are certain fluctuations of the local chemical composition.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Semiconductors</h3>
<div>
<p>Semiconductors are not transparent in the visible spectral region, because their <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a> is smaller than the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> energy of visible light.
However, they exhibit good transparency in the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a>.
For example, silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide are used for <a href="infrared_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems which are suitable for infrared light">infrared optics</a>.
The <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> is usually rather high.</p>
<p>In some cases, semiconductor materials are used for infrared <a href="optical_windows.html" title="flat transparent plates with optical quality, used for protection against the environment">optical windows</a>.
However, there are also applications where special optical properties of semiconductors are exploited.
For example, there are <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a> devices with <a href="quasi_phase_matching.html" title="a technique of achieving a kind of phase matching, using a periodic structure">quasi-phase-matched</a> gallium arsenide.
There is also the whole research area of <a href="silicon_photonics.html" title="photonic technology based on silicon chips">silicon photonics</a>, involving <a href="integrated_optics.html" title="the technology dealing with the construction of photonic integrated circuits">integrated optics</a> on the basis of silicon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Polycrystalline Ceramics</h2>
<div>
<p>Polycrystalline materials have found some applications in optics.
Their basic challenge is the light scattering at grain boundaries.
However, certain transparent ceramic materials like alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG = Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) have been developed with good optical quality including low scattering losses; this can be achieved if the used materials are very pure and the particles of the raw material have very small dimensions, so that the grains also become very small (with nanometer dimensions).
Another important factor are long operating wavelengths (i.e., for <a href="infrared_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems which are suitable for infrared light">infrared optics</a>), since scattering becomes rapidly stronger at shorter wavelengths.</p>
<p>The optical properties of ceramics can be similar to those of glasses.
Therefore, ceramic materials can be used for many types of optical components such as <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>, <a href="prisms.html" title="transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prisms</a>, <a href="optical_windows.html" title="flat transparent plates with optical quality, used for protection against the environment">optical windows</a>, etc.
For example, one can use ceramic windows for <a href="thermal_imaging.html" title="imaging based on thermal radiation">thermal imaging</a> and <a href="night_vision_devices.html" title="instruments which allow viewing or imaging under conditions of very low light levels">night vision devices</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>, YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) ceramics have been developed, which can also be doped e.g. with <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium</a>.
The obtained laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> are very similar to Nd:YAG single crystals but can be cheaper, particularly when large dimensions are needed.
See the article on <a href="ceramic_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which have a ceramic (polycrystalline) microscopic structure">ceramic gain media</a> for more details.</p>
<p>An advantage of ceramics over single crystals is that (similar to glasses) they can be made with very large dimensions without a time-consuming crystal growth procedure.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Organic Polymers</h2>
<div>
<p>Various polymeric materials (plastics) exhibit good transparency, mostly in the visible spectral range and to some extent in the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a>.
Since they are amorphous, they are also called <em>organic glasses</em>.
For various applications, they have a number of attractive properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can generally be <a href="optical_fabrication.html" title="the fabrication of optical components like lenses, prisms and mirrors">fabricated</a> at low cost, e.g. with molding and embossing processes, which also can be used for obtaining <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric</a> surface shapes.
Sometimes, they can be fabricated together with their mounts.</li>
<li>They are lightweight and less fragile than glasses.</li>
<li>They can easily be equipped with dyes for obtaining <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filters</a>.</li>
<li>Some applications require very soft materials, for example optical silicone.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, the achievable optical quality is generally lower than with glasses.
Also, plastic objects are relatively sensitive to temperature changes.
For applications with <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>, they are often not suitable.
Typical applications are ophthalmology, miniature <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photo cameras</a> and optical data storage.</p>
<p>See the article on <a href="plastic_optics.html" title="optical elements made of organic polymer materials">plastic optics</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Materials for Optical Coatings</h2>
<div>
<p>Various transparent materials are used for making <a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">dielectric coatings</a>, i.e., <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coatings</a>, mirror coatings and others for <a href="thin_film_polarizers.html" title="optical polarizers based on a multilayer dielectric coating">thin-film polarizers</a>.
In the simplest cases, a thin film of one material only may be sufficient e.g. as an AR coating, if its refractive index is roughly the square root of the refractive index of the substrate material.
In other cases, multilayer coatings are fabricated.
Mostly, one uses amorphous dielectric materials, although there are also <a href="crystalline_mirrors.html" title="multilayer mirrors where the reflecting parts consist of a monocrystalline material">crystalline mirrors</a> with semiconductor multilayer structures, which are produced with totally different techniques.</p>
<p>Apart from the optical properties it is important that the materials are suitable for use in certain deposition processes.
They should easily and consistently form high-quality layers with good thickness uniformity, high optical homogeneity, low scattering and absorption losses and good adhesion to the substrate.</p>
<p>Some common coating materials are not ideal in all respects.
For example, titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) is often used as a high-index material in multilayer coatings, but depending on the deposition process, different densities of that material may result.
Low-density variants not only have a lower refractive index, but are also more sensitive to environmental conditions; in particular, water vapor may be absorbed, and that modifies the optical properties of the coating.
Other materials like silica are much less sensitive to such effects.
There are also deposition methods (e.g. IAD = ion-assisted deposition) which produce relatively dense coatings even with TiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>In any case, one should be aware that the refractive indices can vary to some extent, depending on the used deposition method and even on the environmental conditions during operation.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Essential Properties of Transparent Optical Materials</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Optical Properties</h3>
<div>
<p>The following properties are usually relevant for the use of optical materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>A high degree of transparency in the relevant <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> range is usually required.
Transparency is mostly limited by absorption processes &ndash; either the intrinsic absorption of the material or absorption from impurities &ndash; and sometimes also by light scattering at inhomogeneities.
Diagrams for the <a href="transmittance.html" title="the ratio of transmitted optical power to the incident optical power at some partial transparent object">transmittance</a> versus wavelength, as often found in the literature, can also contain the effect of <a href="fresnel_reflections.html" title="light reflections at optical interfaces">Fresnel reflections</a> at the end faces of a block of the material.</li>
<li>Good optical homogeneity is also often required.</li>
<li>The <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> tells by which amount the <a href="phase_velocity.html" title="the velocity with which phase fronts propagate in a medium">phase velocity</a> of light is reduced in the material, compared with vacuum.
Its wavelength dependence determines the <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>, which may be quantified in different ways, e.g. via the wavelength-dependent <a href="group_velocity_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the group velocity in a medium, or (quantitatively) the derivative of the inverse group velocity with respect to angular frequency">group velocity dispersion</a> (GVD) or roughly with the <a href="abbe_number.html" title="a measure for the chromatic dispersion of a transparent material">Abbe number</a> (where high values indicate low dispersion).</li>
<li>Most optical materials are optically isotropic, i.e., the optical properties do not depend on the direction of light propagation and polarization.
However, some optical materials are anisotropic and subsequently <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringent</a>, which means that the refractive index depends on the propagation direction at the <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a> direction.
There may also be a dependence of absorption losses on the propagation direction or polarization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, further optical properties are also important:</p>
<ul>
<li>A frequently relevant quantity is the temperature derivative of the refractive index (<span class="eqn_il">dn&thinsp;/&thinsp;dT</span>).
For glasses, it can be positive or negative, so that in some situations it is possible to achieve temperature compensation by proper combinations of materials.</li>
<li>Optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>, quantified e.g. with the <a href="nonlinear_index.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the Kerr nonlinearity of a medium">nonlinear index</a>, can play a role for applications involving high optical <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">intensities</a>, e.g. in <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a> and <a href="ultrafast_amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers for ultrashort (femtosecond or picosecond) optical pulses">amplifiers</a>.</li>
<li>Some materials emit <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a>, e.g. under UV irradiation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Other Properties</h3>
<div>
<p>Various other properties can also be relevant for applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanical properties, particularly Young's modulus, yield point, hardness and robustness or fragility, are essential in many cases &ndash; partly for the operation and partly for the fabrication.</li>
<li>The threshold for optical damage via <a href="laser_induced_breakdown.html" title="a kind of spark, initiated by intense laser light">laser-induced breakdown</a> can strongly depend on the used materials.</li>
<li>The thermal shock resistance depends not only on hardness, but also on thermal expansion coefficients.</li>
<li>Optical elements have a limited temperature range in which they can be used, e.g. due to melting or softening.
This applies particularly to <a href="plastic_optics.html" title="optical elements made of organic polymer materials">plastic optics</a>.</li>
<li>Some materials are less resistant than others to irradiation with <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> or higher energy radiation (e.g. in space applications), which may generate <a href="color_centers.html" title="crystal defects which introduce additional light absorption or emission features in crystalline materials">color centers</a> and thus reduce the transparency.</li>
<li>The chemical stability may be relevant if optical materials come into contact with certain fluids (e.g. water) or gases (e.g. water vapor and oxygen).
It may be substantially lower for operation at elevated temperatures.</li>
<li>Most optical materials are electrical insulators, but there are applications where some electrical conductance is required, for example for shielding purposes.</li>
<li>Some material properties can be relevant for the fabrication processes.
This applies to mechanical properties, for example.
As another example, glasses with a too narrow glass transition temperature range are difficult to draw into optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>.</li>
<li>The compatibility with other materials or <a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">dielectric coatings</a>, e.g. in terms of thermal expansion coefficient, can also be relevant.</li>
<li>Certain optical materials should be avoided where possible because they contain poisonous substances.</li>
<li>Availability and cost are of course also of interest.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Metals</h2>
<div>
<p>Metals are mostly used for reflectors (<a href="mirrors.html" title="devices which reflect light">mirrors</a>).
Often, they are applied only in the form of thin films deposited on dielectric materials (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="metal_coated_mirrors.html" title="mirrors where the reflection is obtained from a metal coating"><em>metal-coated mirrors</em></a>).
In other cases, solid metal parts with polished surfaces are used as a very robust reflectors, for example in certain <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power lasers</a>.</p>
<p>Frequently used metals for applications in reflectors are gold and silver, aluminum, chrome and various nickel/chrome alloys.
They are mostly made as <a href="first_surface_mirrors.html" title="metal-coated mirrors reality metallic mineral coating is on the front surface of the mirror substrate">first surface mirrors</a>.
In some cases, metal surfaces are protected with additional transparent coatings; for example, there are protected silver coatings, which are much less sensitive e.g. against touching the surface with a finger.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Photonic Metamaterials</h2>
<div>
<p>There are certain artificial <a href="photonic_metamaterials.html" title="nanostructured materials with special optical properties">photonic metamaterials</a>, which can have very unusual optical properties.
For example, some of them have a negative refractive index.</p>
