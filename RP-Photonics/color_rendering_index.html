<p>The perception of colors of objects can be modified by certain spectral properties of light sources used for illumination.
The color rendering index (CRI) is a quantitative measure for estimating how strong such effects are for a particular light source.</p>
<p>In the following, the physical basis of color perception of objects is explained, and also which role the details of the illumination plays in that context.
Thereafter, the principles underlying the definition of the color rendering index are explained, and some typical cases are discussed.
See also the article on <a href="color_vision.html" title="vision with some capability for spectral analysis of the light">color vision</a> for more fundamental aspects.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Physical Principles</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Color Perception and Illumination</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">White illumination light can be turned into colored light by wavelength-dependent transmission or reflection.</aside>
<p>The colors of objects can be seen only if a suitable illumination is provided.
The most basic condition for color perception is that the incident <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> contains a substantial range of spectral components, which are associated with different colors.
Usually, one will use <a href="white_light.html" title="light which creates a white color impression">white light</a>, e.g. daylight, being a mixture of all visible spectrum components, or some artificial <a href="white_light_sources.html" title="light sources with very broad optical bandwidth">white light source</a>.
The color balance of light which is transmitted or reflected (or <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattered</a>) at colored objects is then modified according to the wavelength-dependent <a href="transmittance.html" title="the ratio of transmitted optical power to the incident optical power at some partial transparent object">transmittance</a> or <a href="reflectance.html" title="the ratio of reflected optical power to the incident optical power at some reflecting object">reflectance</a>.
Thus, the transmitted or reflected light produces a color impression, while the incident white light did not when directing reaching the eye.
For example, if an object strongly <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorbs</a> the shorter-wavelength components of the incident light (in the blue and violet region), the transmitted or reflected light will be primarily consisting of the longer-wavelength components, which create a red or orange appearance of the object.
Similarly, a green appearance arises if the medium <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> components of the white light are preserved while the longer- and shorter-wavelength components are attenuated.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Problems for Non-white Light</h3>
<div>
<p>Most serious problems with color perception arise if the illumination light is not white.
An extreme example case is the illumination with a low-pressure <a href="sodium_vapor_lamps.html" title="metal vapor lamps based on light emission from sodium (Na) atoms">sodium vapor lamps</a>, which emits only yellow light &ndash; not far from <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic light</a> (single-color light).
In such a case, no illuminated object can ever appear green or blue or deep red, because light with such colors is simply not present in that situation (except if the object exhibits <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a>).</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">The Case of a Structured Optical Spectrum</h3>
<div>
<p>Less severe color perception problems occur if the illumination light contains a wide, but not continuous distribution of wavelength components &ndash; for example, if the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> of the light source consists only of some limited number of <a href="spectral_lines.html" title="narrow spectral features related to emission or absorption lines of certain substances">spectral lines</a>.
The illumination light may then still appear white, e.g. quite similar to daylight, and illuminated objects can appear with various colors.
However, the color impression may then substantially deviate from that for illumination with broadband (continuous-spectrum) light.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">It depends on details of a colored object how its color appearance depends on the properties of the illumination.</aside>
<p>As an example, consider an object which efficiently scatters most wavelength components while strongly absorbing a narrow range of wavelength components e.g. in the blue spectral range.
If the light source happens to emit blue light only within that strongly absorbing region, a strong color impression (e.g. deeply saturated orange) can occur.
In daylight, however, that orange color would be much less saturated, since only a small part of the incident blue light can be absorbed due to the narrow absorption bandwidth.</p>
<p>Another object, where the absorption in the blue region is more broadband but outside the emission lines of the light source, may appear white under the artificial illumination, since it cannot absorb any of the incident light, while under daylight it appears colored.
Such color deviations are what is meant with a limited <em>color rendering capability</em> of such light sources.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Common Light Sources with Limited Color Rendering</h3>
<div>
<p>Such types of color perception problems occur for various artificial light sources, in particular for the following types:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Fluorescent lamps, some other gas discharge lamps and LED lamps are typical light sources with potentially poor color rendering.</aside>
<ul>
<li><a href="fluorescent_lamps.html" title="lamps which emit fluorescent light, usually generated by irradiation of a phosphor with light from an electric gas discharge">Fluorescent lamps</a> exhibit some combination of spectral lines (often above some continuum), determined by the used type of <a href="phosphors.html" title="substances which exhibit luminescence, used mostly for illumination and displays">phosphor</a>.
Earlier models, containing a phosphor with light emission essentially only in two different wavelength regions, had quite poor color rendering properties.
Nowadays, a triphosphor mixture is common; this has much improved color rendering and also an improved <a href="luminous_efficacy_and_efficiency.html" title="the luminous flux of a light source divided by its the radiant power or its electrical consumption (efficacy); the ratio of reached efficacy to the theoretically possible efficacy (luminous efficiency)">luminous efficacy</a>.
There are special phosphor mixtures with even better color rendering, but a reduced efficacy.</li>
<li>Some other types of <a href="gas_discharge_lamps.html" title="light sources which are based on an electrical discharge in an ionized gas or metal vapor">gas discharge lamps</a> also emit light with the spectrum featuring prominent peaks, but depending on the type of lamp, there can also be a broad continuum &ndash; particularly for high pressure discharge lamps.
For example, <a href="high_intensity_discharge_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps operating with high power density">high intensity discharge lamps</a> based on <a href="xenon_lamps.html" title="lamps based on an electrical discharge in xenon gas">xenon</a> have a quite smooth emission spectrum, causing minimal color deviations.</li>
<li>White <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diodes</a> (LEDs) also have a quite structured spectrum &ndash; often a combination of blue light, which is directly emitted by the LEDs, with <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> e.g. in the yellow spectral region from a phosphor which is excited by absorbing part of the blue light.
Just as for fluorescent lamps, there are different LED designs, using different phosphors which can significantly vary in terms of color rendering.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">How Critical are Color Rendering Limitations?</h3>
<div>
<p>How serious color perception problems are in practice, depends on three aspects:</p>
<aside class="callout red">The color rendering does not depend on the light source alone, but also on the illuminated objects and on how color-critical the application is!</aside>
<ul>
<li>on the details of the optical spectrum of the light source,</li>
<li class="ta_left">on the spectral properties of the illuminated objects (e.g. whether they exhibit narrow absorption features), and</li>
<li class="ta_left">on how color-critical the application is.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, color details are often not particularly important for lighting of offices and manufacturing workplaces, while they can be critical in the context of fashion or arts.
Fortunately, the spectral absorption features of most colored objects are relatively broadband, so that really severe color deviations are rare, even for illumination with light having a quite structured optical spectrum.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Definition of the Color Rendering Index</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">The determination of the color rendering index of a light source requires a quite sophisticated process.</aside>
<p>While the principles of color rendering problems, as explained above, have been known for a long time, it has been difficult to develop the <em>color rendering index</em> (CRI) as a quantitative measure for the color rendering qualities of light sources.
That work has been supervised by CIE, the International Commission on Illumination.
A quite sophisticated procedure for determining the CRI of a light source has been developed.
One first determines the correlated <a href="color_temperature.html" title="the temperature of a blackbody radiator which leads to a color impression of the thermal light which matches most closely the light of a light source">color temperature</a> of the source.
One then defines a reference light source, which is a <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">blackbody source</a> if the color temperature is below 5000&nbsp;K, and the CIE standard illuminant D in other cases.
(Note the discontinuity of the definition at 5000&nbsp;K.)
One essentially measures resulting deviations of color appearance between the test source and the reference source for some number of standardized test samples and combines the results in a mathematically complicated way to finally obtain the color rendering index.
That number is 100 in the ideal case (e.g. for blackbody radiation) and lower otherwise.
Negative values are in principle possible, but basically never occur in practice.</p>
<p>The color rendering index is defined only for more or less white light sources, although color temperatures can vary in a substantial range.</p>
<p>Note that color rendering can also be an important issue in the context of displays, e.g. <a href="liquid_crystal_displays.html" title="displays based on liquid crystal modulators">liquid crystal displays</a>.
However, the concept of the color rendering index cannot be applied there; the same applies to displays based on <a href="rgb_sources.html" title="source of red, green and blue light, which is usually provided in the form laser beams">RGB sources</a>.
The reason for that is that the aspect of illuminating colored objects is not involved in such cases.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Example Cases in Lighting</h2>
<div>
<p>For many light sources with a smooth, continuous spectrum &ndash; for example, <a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">incandescent lamps</a> including <a href="halogen_lamps.html" title="incandescent lamps with a halogen filling, allowing for higher operation temperatures">halogen lamps</a>, but also high-pressure <a href="xenon_lamps.html" title="lamps based on an electrical discharge in xenon gas">xenon lamps</a> &ndash; the color rendering index is above 95.
There should then be no significant color rendering issues even in critical applications.
Generally, CRI values above 90 can be considered as excellent.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Fluorescent lamps are often said to be poor in terms of color rendering, but this is not always true.</aside>
<p><a href="fluorescent_lamps.html" title="lamps which emit fluorescent light, usually generated by irradiation of a phosphor with light from an electric gas discharge">Fluorescent lamps</a> with old-style phosphors (calcium halophosphate phosphors) exhibited fairly low CRI values around 50 to 70.
For such poor values, significant color deviations can occur, which can still be considered as acceptable for ordinary lighting applications.
However, third-generation lamps with triphosphors, containing europium and terbium and emitting a combination of blue, green and orange&ndash;red light, are performing much better both in terms of CRI (around 85) and <a href="luminous_efficacy_and_efficiency.html" title="the luminous flux of a light source divided by its the radiant power or its electrical consumption (efficacy); the ratio of reached efficacy to the theoretically possible efficacy (luminous efficiency)">luminous efficacy</a> (80&ndash;95&nbsp;lm/W).
Further, there are multi-phosphor tubes with a CRI of 95 or sometimes even more, offering close to perfect color rendering, but often a lower luminous efficacy, effectively leading to higher electricity consumption.
There is thus often a trade-off between optimum CRI and highest efficacy (energy efficiency), and sometimes also with manufacturing cost.
As a result, many lamps are used in practice where the color rendering is reasonably good, but not the highest technically possible.</p>
<p>Ordinary consumer LED lamps often have a CRI around 80.
With improved designs, values above 90 are possible.
However, that may not only lead to increased production cost, but also to a reduced luminous efficacy &ndash; just as for fluorescent lamps.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Limitations of the Color Rendering Index</h2>
<div>
<p>The color rendering index as defined by CIE is a reasonable measure for the color rendering qualities of light sources.
However, the concept is not perfect:</p>
<ul>
<li>As already mentioned above, the method is rather complicated to apply.</li>
<li class="ta_left">Due to various imperfections, the CRI is not a perfectly reliable measure.
Improved versions, e.g. with an increased number of test samples and modified color transforms have been proposed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, the CRI of CIE in its official form is still the most widely accepted measure.
It is now common that the specifications of lighting products contain the color rendering index in addition to the color temperature and the luminous efficacy.</p>

<h2>Numerical Modeling</h2>
<p>Developing devices or systems in photonics requires a <b>comprehensive quantitative understanding</b> &ndash; otherwise, it becomes inefficient, waisting time and money.</p>
<p><a href="./laser_modeling.html?banner=numerical_modeling">Numerical modeling</a> is often the most efficient way towards results:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand <em>quantitatively</em> what is going on</li>
<li>check the influence of design changes or possible detrimental effects</li>
<li>understand strange experimental observations</li>
<li>find optimized designs more reliably and faster</li>
</ul>
