<div>
<p>In a three-level system, the <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transition</a> ends on the ground state.
The unpumped gain medium exhibits strong absorption on the laser transition.
A <a href="population_inversion.html" title="a state of a medium where a higher-lying electronic level has a higher population than a lower-lying level">population inversion</a> and consequently net laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> result only when more than half of the ions (or atoms) are <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">pumped</a> into the upper laser level; the <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump power</a> is thus fairly high.</p>
<p>The population inversion can be achieved only by pumping into a higher-lying level, followed by a rapid radiative or <a href="non_radiative_transitions.html" title="transitions between energy levels of atoms or ions which are not associated with the emission of light">non-radiative</a> transfer into the upper laser level, because in this way one avoids <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a> caused by the pump wave.
(For transitions between only two levels, simultaneous <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> and signal amplification can not occur.)</p>

<p>Pure three-level laser gain media are seldom used, while quasi-three-level media (see below) are quite common, particularly in the context of <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Four-Level Systems</h2>
<div>
<p>A lower threshold pump power can be achieved with a four-level laser medium, where the lower laser level is well above the ground state and is quickly depopulated e.g. by <a href="multi_phonon_transitions.html" title="transitions between electronic levels of atoms or ions in solid media, involving the emission of multiple phonons">multi-phonon transitions</a>.
Ideally, no appreciable population density in the lower laser level can occur even during laser operation.
In that way, reabsorption of the laser radiation is avoided (provided that there is no absorption on other transitions).
This means that there is no absorption of the gain medium in the unpumped state, and the <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> usually rises linearly with the absorbed pump power.</p>
<p>The most popular four-level solid-state gain medium is <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG</a>.
All lasers based on <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium-doped gain media</a>, except those operated on the ground-state transition around 0.9&ndash;0.95&nbsp;&mu;m, are four-level lasers.</p>
<p>Neodymium ions can also be directly pumped into the upper laser level, e.g. with pump light around 880&nbsp;nm for Nd:YAG.
Even though effectively only three levels are involved, the term <em>three-level system</em> would not be used here.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Quasi-Three-Level Systems</h2>
<div>
<p>A quasi-three-level laser medium is one with a kind of intermediate situation, where the lower laser level is so close to the ground state that an appreciable population in that level occurs in thermal equilibrium at the operating temperature.
As a consequence, the unpumped gain medium causes some reabsorption loss at the laser wavelength, and transparency is reached only for some finite pump intensity.
For higher pump intensities, there is gain, as required for laser operation.</p>
<p>Examples of quasi-three-level media are all <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped gain media</a> (e.g. Yb:YAG, or Yb:glass as used in optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>), neodymium-doped media operated on the ground state transition (e.g. 946&nbsp;nm for Nd:YAG), thulium-doped crystals and glasses for 2-&mu;m emission, and <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium-doped</a> media for 1.5 or 1.6-&mu;m emission, such as <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a>.</p>
<p>An important fact is that the spectral shape of the optical gain in a quasi-three-level laser medium depends on the excitation level, because this affects the balance between emission and reabsorption.
As a consequence, the laser wavelength obtained may depend on the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> losses: high losses require a higher gain, and thus a higher excitation level, and consequently a shorter wavelength of maximum gain.
(Note that the reabsorption is stronger at shorter wavelengths, thus particularly reducing the short-wavelength net gain for low excitation levels.)
Similarly, the wavelength of maximum gain can be reduced by reducing the <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a>, because this also implies a higher excitation density.
On the other hand, this measure may reduce the efficiency of pump absorption.
Therefore, there can be a trade-off between short-wavelength operation (with small <a href="quantum_defect.html" title="energy difference between pump and laser photons">quantum defect</a>) and efficient pump absorption.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/erbium_gain.png" alt="erbium gain">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Gain and absorption (negative gain) of erbium (Er<sup>3+</sup>) ions in germano-alumino-silicate glass for excitation levels from 0 to 100&#37; in steps of 20&#37;. Strong three-level behavior (with transparency reached only for &gt;&thinsp;50&#37; excitation) occurs at 1530&nbsp;nm. At longer wavelengths (e.g. 1580&nbsp;nm), a lower excitation level is required for obtaining gain, but the maximum gain is smaller.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There can actually be a smooth transition from three-level to four-level gain characteristics with increasing laser wavelength.
For example, erbium-doped glass (see Figure&nbsp;2) shows strong three-level behavior around 1535&nbsp;nm but nearly four-level behavior for long wavelengths of e.g. 1600&nbsp;nm.
Similarly, <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium</a>-doped glass exhibits pronounced three-level characteristics for wavelengths below &asymp;&thinsp;1040&nbsp;nm, and the same holds for <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Yb:YAG lasers</a> at 1030&nbsp;nm and for lasers based on many other <a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">rare earth</a> crystals.
For operation at such wavelengths, a large inversion density is required for overcoming the reabsorption loss.
For longer wavelengths, as sometimes used particularly in <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>, there is hardly any reabsorption, and in a long fiber only a very low excitation density may be required to obtain sufficient gain.</p>
<p>Pronounced three-level behavior is inevitable for gain media with a very small <a href="quantum_defect.html" title="energy difference between pump and laser photons">quantum defect</a>, because this enforces a small energy spacing between the lower laser level and the ground state, so that thermal population of the lower laser level is significant.</p>
<p>By reducing the temperature of the laser crystal, it is possible to obtain less pronounced three-level characteristics, i.e., a reduced degree of reabsorption on the laser wavelength.
This is essentially because the population in higher-lying sublevels of the ground state manifold is reduced.
As an example, Yb:YAG has pronounced three-level characteristics at 1030&nbsp;nm when operated at room temperature, while essentially four-level characteristics are obtained for <a href="cryogenic_lasers.html" title="lasers where the gain medium is operated at cryogenic temperatures">cryogenic operation</a> at 77&nbsp;K (the temperature of liquid nitrogen).</p>
<p>Note that the gain media of <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a> actually also behave like three-level lasers, exhibiting losses in the unpumped state and a shape of the gain spectrum which depends on the excitation density.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Common Errors</h2>
<div>
<p>In the literature, a profound misunderstanding of various aspects related to three-level gain media is sometimes encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is sometimes not understood that the reabsorption does not constitute a real loss of energy, because it excites ions into the upper level, so that stimulated emission can again occur at a later time.
Nevertheless, three-level characteristics tend to decrease the laser efficiency for other reasons: they require higher excitation densities, leading to higher losses through <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a>, and they usually do not permit the gain medium to be made long enough for complete pump absorption, because reabsorption would dominate in weakly pumped regions.</li>
<li>Another frequent mistake is to believe that (according to Einstein's original simple model) there are equal <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">transition cross sections</a> for stimulated emission and reabsorption, although this does not hold for <a href="effective_transition_cross_sections.html" title="a modified type of transition cross sections which apply to optical transitions between Stark level manifolds">effective transition cross sections</a> of transitions between level manifolds with non-degenerate Stark levels, as often occur in <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> gain media.</li>
<li>The <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation fluence</a> is often not calculated correctly: it is the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon energy</a> divided by the sum of emission and absorption <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a>.</li>
<li>It is not true that reabsorption in a three-level gain medium (whether in an unpumped region or not) acts like a <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a>, leading to <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q-switching</a> effects and the like.
For such effects, the cross sections of the absorber would have to be larger than those of the gain medium.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="questions togglediv">Questions and Comments from Users</h2>
<div class="comment">
<p class="comment_details">2020-06-15</p>
<p>Suppose you have a quasi three-level system with the lower laser level being one of the Stark split levels of the ground state.
Normally, this state sees thermal population due to the Boltzmann distribution.
Now assume the system is inverted and starts lasing.
The ions from the upper laser level transition into the the lower laser level.
This &ndash; in theory &ndash; limits the extracted energy to 1/2 of the initial population above transparency, but it depends on the ability of the lower level to thermally equalize faster or slower than the extraction.
Suppose you have a Q-switched laser producing &thinsp;10&ndash;30&nbsp;ns pulses.
Does the lower state equalize fast enough (i.e. in &lt;1&ndash;10&nbsp;ns) so the extracted energy is higher than the 1/2 of the initial population?</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>First of all, the energy limitation is usually weaker than by a factor of 2, since due to the Boltzmann distribution at moderate temperatures you need much less than 50&#37; excitation for obtaining positive net gain.</p>
<p>The relaxation within a Stark level manifold is usually fast enough in a Q-switched laser &ndash; it occurs on a picosecond timescale.</p>

<h2>Corona Virus Crisis</h2>
<p>It is interesting and instructive to realize certain analogies between the spread of an epidemic and elementary processes in lasers. In particular, one can <b>learn about the power of expnential growth</b> and the <b>threshold behavior</b>.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:20px;">Stand up for Science!</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">It is acceptable that some don't know much about photons, biological evolution or global warming.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">But we don't want bigot ignorants to make political decisions and educate our children!</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">For example, <b>global warming</b> is not a matter of political opinion, but a fact. Ruthless profiteers are leading astray millions of uneducated people, seducing them to take utterly irresponsible positions. <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">But we cannot risk catastrophic climate changes!</span> Science tells us it is high time to act. Read, for example, the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/">IPCC Synthesis Report</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold;">Stand up for science (perhaps by joining a <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/">March for Science</a>) &ndash; it's our future!</p>
