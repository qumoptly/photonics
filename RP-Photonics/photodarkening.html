<p>Various transparent optical media such as optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> and <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a> exhibit photodarkening (sometimes also called <em>photochromic damage</em> or <em>photo-induced absorption</em>) when they are irradiated with light at certain wavelengths.
This means that the transmission losses resulting from <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> or <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattering</a> grow with time.
The mechanisms involved and the characteristic parameters (e.g. the maximum amount of losses, its spectral shape, the dependence on light intensity, wavelength and duration of irradiation, and the reversibility) can vary greatly, depending on the material.
In many cases, the photodarkening mechanism involves the formation of <a href="color_centers.html" title="crystal defects which introduce additional light absorption or emission features in crystalline materials">color centers</a> or other microscopic structural transformations in the medium.
Photodarkening can lead to serious performance degradations and lifetime limitations of optical devices, and its minimization may require the optimization of materials and operation conditions.</p>
<p>In the following sections, some technologically important situations with unwanted and sometimes reversible photodarkening effects are discussed.
See also the article on <a href="photochromic_materials.html" title="optical materials which exhibit increased light absorption when being exposed to light">photochromic materials</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Photodarkening Caused by Ultraviolet Light</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">Silica fibers</a> can transmit <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>, but with <a href="propagation_losses.html" title="losses of optical energy during propagation of light">propagation losses</a> which are significantly higher than in the visible or near-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region.
In addition, a rapid further increase in losses can be induced by the ultraviolet light.
To a significant extent, this UV-induced photodarkening can be reduced with certain dopants (e.g. fluorine) or other treatments.
Fibers with high hydroxyl (OH) content are often found to be superior to low-OH fibers, even though the latter have better transmission in the near-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> region.
However, there are also low-OH fibers with good UV transmission and resistance.
Also, hydrogen-impregnated fibers can exhibit drastically improved resistance against irradiation with <a href="excimer_lasers.html" title="lasers where optical amplification occurs in a plasma containing excited dimers (or other molecules) with an anti-binding electronic ground state">excimer laser</a> light at 193&nbsp;nm [15], even though hydrogen loading is in other cases used for increasing the photosensitivity of fibers for UV writing of <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a>.
Certainly, the effectiveness of such methods for improved UV transmission and resistance depends strongly on the wavelengths involved.</p>
<p>Even blue light can cause photodarkening in silica-based fibers, when they are doped with germanium [1].
The damage mechanism involves a <a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">two-photon excitation process</a>.</p>
<p>Note that similar photodarkening can result from irradiation with gamma rays.
This is relevant e.g. for space applications of fiber devices.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Photodarkening in Ytterbium-doped Silica Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">Ytterbium-doped</a> optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> can exhibit severe transmission losses, which are strongest at short wavelengths (e.g. in the visible spectral range) and much weaker (but still important) e.g. in the 1-&mu;m spectral region, where ytterbium-doped <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a> operate.
Such losses can occur in new fibers [7] but can also grow during operation of a fiber laser or amplifier [17].
The rate with which these losses grow appears to be proportional to the seventh power of the density of excited ytterbium ions [17].
This means that a fast degradation of such fibers can result from operation with a high fractional ytterbium excitation density (as can occur, e.g., in core-pumped <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>), particularly for fibers with a high <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a> and poor homogeneity (<em>formation of ion clusters</em>).
On the other hand, the strong dependence on the excitation density suggests that many devices can be designed to operate in a relatively safe operating regime where long device lifetimes can be expected.
Difficult cases are those where a high doping concentration is required (e.g. in order to mitigate nonlinear effects via a reduced fiber length), or where high excitation levels are inevitable (e.g. fiber lasers operating around 975&nbsp;nm).</p>
<p>The photodarkening effect normally appears to be permanent, although it has been demonstrated that it can be reversed by heating the fiber [18] or by irradiation with <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> [19].
Further studies will hopefully reveal the detailed physical mechanism and the dependence on the chemical composition of the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>.
There is evidence for the belief that the formation of Yb<sup>2+</sup> ions plays an important role [21], although it is not yet clear how Yb<sup>2+</sup> ions can be generated by exciting Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions.
It is already known that Yb-doped <a href="phosphate_glasses.html" title="certain glasses from which certain optical fibers and laser gain media can be made, for example">phosphate</a> fibers [20] and phosphosilicate fibers [21] exhibit much weaker photodarkening.
Also, codoping with cerium appears to improve the durability of Yb-doped fibers [22,&thinsp;23].</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Photodarkening in Thulium-doped Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>There are reports of photodarkening occurring in thulium-doped <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> [2], more precisely in phosphosilicate and germanosilicate <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">glasses</a>, where a broadband loss (particularly at short wavelengths) occurs following irradiation with high peak powers, e.g. from a <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a>.
A crucial ingredient is the excitation of high-lying energy levels of the Tm<sup>3+</sup> ions.
This phenomenon may not be technologically serious, since thulium-doped silica fibers are used for <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> infrared lasers where high pump intensities and high concentrations of highly excited thulium ions are not required.</p>
<p>The situation is different for thulium-doped <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride fibers</a> as used mainly for <a href="upconversion_lasers.html" title="lasers relying on upconversion processes">upconversion fiber lasers</a>, generating <a href="blue_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting blue light">blue light</a> when being pumped with infrared light e.g. around 1140&nbsp;nm.
Although this three-step upconversion scheme could in principle be very efficient [8], the actual device performance can be severely degraded by photodarkening [5,&thinsp;6].
As for silica fibers, it is believed that photodarkening is related to the formation of <a href="color_centers.html" title="crystal defects which introduce additional light absorption or emission features in crystalline materials">color centers</a>, which becomes possible if ions are excited to energies above the <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a> of the host glass.
Absorption of blue light (e.g. via upconversion lasing) has been shown to reduce at least temporarily the induced absorption, probably by removing color centers.
In this sense, the photodarkening is partially reversible.
The physical details are very complicated and have so far not been fully understood.</p>
<p>Photodarkening effects have also been reported for other <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>, e.g. with dopants such as praseodymium (Pr<sup>3+</sup>), thulium (Tm<sup>3+</sup>), cerium (Ce<sup>3+</sup>), and terbium (Tb<sup>3+</sup>).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Photodarkening in Silver Halide Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>Polycrystalline silver halide fibers (based on AgBrCl) can be used for transmitting mid-infrared light in a very wide wavelength region, extending up to &asymp;18&nbsp;&mu;m.
Unfortunately, these materials exhibit photodarkening when exposed to visible light.
The effect is related to the formation of metallic silver particles (colloides).
It can be avoided by using a protective coating [13].</p>
<p>Note that silver chloride in microcrystalline form is sometimes intentionally added to glasses (e.g. sunglasses) to make them <a href="photochromic_materials.html" title="optical materials which exhibit increased light absorption when being exposed to light">photochromic</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Induced Losses in Nonlinear Crystals</h2>
<div>
<p>Some <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a> exhibit induced absorption when irradiated with light having short wavelengths in the visible or <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> spectral region (see e.g. Ref. [4]).
The best known is the effect of reversible green-induced infrared absorption (GRIIRA) in materials such as lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>), lithium tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>), and potassium titanyl phosphate (KTiOPO<sub>4</sub>, KTP).
Particularly in the case of KTP, this is often called <em>gray tracking</em>; a gray line (track) is observed where the crystal has been irradiated.</p>
<p>Such effects are often reversible, but may also lead to permanent photochromic damage when the device is operated for a longer time.
They are observed e.g. in <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doublers</a> which are pumped with 1-&mu;m lasers (e.g. <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">YAG lasers</a>), or in <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillators</a> pumped at shorter wavelengths, and similar effects are observed for <a href="blue_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting blue light">blue light</a> (<em>blue-induced infrared absorption</em>, BLIIRA).
For high-power devices, the resulting heating can seriously disturb the <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase matching</a> and also lead to <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>.
Particularly the former effect can make the conversion process unstable.</p>
<p>In niobates, the induced absorption appears to be related to the formation of polarons (electrons trapped by antisite niobium ions), also called color centers, which can result e.g. from <a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">two-photon absorption</a>.
It can be greatly reduced by doping the material with magnesium oxide (MgO) [11] and/or by using stoichiometric material, which contains fewer of the intrinsic niobium antisite defects.
At the same time, both measures reduce the tendency for photorefractive beam distortions, as they increase the ionic conductivity.</p>
<p>In KTP, the induced absorption is also attributed to polarons; carriers may in that case be captured e.g. by Ti<sup>4+</sup> ions or by Fe<sup>3+</sup> impurities.
An important difference from niobates is that induced absorption appears to occur only for <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a> with sufficiently high peak intensity.
Gray tracking usually disappears within a few hours after irradiation.
Its strength depends on the crystal quality and thus on the fabrication method.
Other important parameters are the pulse duration and pulse repetition rate.</p>
