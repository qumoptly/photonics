</header>
<p>In <a href="photonics.html" title="the science and technology of light">photonics</a>, a focal plane array (FPA) is essentially an array of light detectors, which is placed in the <a href="focal_points_and_focal_planes.html" title="points to which parallel input rays are concentrated by an optical system, and the planes going through those points">focal plane</a> of an <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> system (a simple <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> or an <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objective</a>, possibly a <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescope</a>).
It would actually be more accurate to talk about an <a href="image_planes.html" title="planes which are conjugate to an object plane, so that objects are imaged there">image plane</a> instead of a focal plane, which is not exactly the same.</p>
<p>Typically, a focal plane array is a rectangular two-dimensional array containing many thousands or even a several million detectors.
The detectors can be either <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> (e.g. <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> or <a href="photoconductive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which exhibit a reduction in electrical resistance caused by incoming light">photoconductive detectors</a>) or <a href="thermal_detectors.html" title="light detectors which are based on measuring light-induced temperature rises">thermal detectors</a> (e.g. microbolometers), add typically each detector has dimensions between a few microns and a few tens of microns.
Extremely sensitive and fast detection including <a href="photon_counting.html" title="photodetection at low light levels where single photon absorption events are counted">photon counting</a> is possible with arrays of Geiger-mode <a href="avalanche_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with internal signal amplification through an avalanche process">avalanche photodiodes</a> (SPADs).</p>
<p>The alternative term <em>staring array</em> comes from the fact that in conjunction with the imaging optics an FPA receives radiation only from some range of directions.</p>
<p>The term <em>focal plane array</em> is also known in radio astronomy for arrays of receivers, which can be of different types.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Key Properties</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Resolution</h3>
<div>
<p>With the resolution one usually means the number of detector pixels in both directions &ndash; for example, 1024 &times; 1024, 3072 &times; 2048 or 4096 &times; 4096 pixels.
This limits the achievable image resolution, provided that the quality of the imaging <a href="optics.html" title="the science and technology dealing with the properties and the propagation of light">optics</a> is good enough.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Readout Electronics</h3>
<div>
<p>Besides the detectors themselves, focal plane arrays can contain additional readout and processing electronics.
Some of them produce digital output signals, while others have analog outputs.
For example, CCD chips sequentially deliver analog voltages corresponding to the different pixels, while CMOS chips digitize the signals.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Spectral Response</h3>
<div>
<p>The <a href="spectral_response_of_a_photodetector.html" title="the range of optical wavelengths for which a photodetector is sensitive">spectral response</a> is determined by the used detector technology.
FPGAs are available for very different spectral regions, including not only visible, <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> and <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>, but also for X-rays.</p>
<p>Silicon-based FPAs are sensitive for visible light and short-wavelength near-infrared light, but not for longer wavelengths &ndash; except for Schottky-barrier detectors, which however exhibit fairly low <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiencies</a>.
However, there are also focal plane arrays containing <a href="infrared_detectors.html" title="detectors for infrared light">infrared detectors</a> for <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> of several micrometers.
For example, they can be based on mercury cadmium telluride (MCT, Hg<sub>x</sub>Cd<sub>1&minus;x</sub>Te), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), indium antimonide (InSb), PtSi (Schottky barrier detectors), QWIPs (quantum well infrared photodetectors) or microbolometers.</p>
<p>There are also dual-band and even multicolor infrared focal plane arrays, which can for example measure the intensity of mid-wave and long-wave infrared radiation independently.
That is essential for some military applications, for example.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Monolithic vs. Hybrid FPAs</h3>
<div>
<p>One distinguishes monolithic and hybrid focal plane array architectures.
The simplest fabrication methods produce <em>monolithic FPAs</em>, e.g. all based on silicon technology.
That technology strongly profits from the progress in related technologies such as DRAM memory.
Silicon technology, however, usually restricts the spectral sensitivity to the visible and near-infrared range.
Therefore, one also uses <em>hybrid devices</em>, which are assembled for example with flip-chip bonding of two different wafers: a light-sensitive part, e.g. based on III-V semiconductors, and an electronic part based on silicon.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Dynamic Range</h3>
<div>
<p>For analog FPAs, the dynamic range is determined by the maximum output signal and the noise floor.
For digital FPAs, the number of bits per pixel reflects the dynamic range.
For example, 10 bits allow for 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 different output values, corresponding to &approx;30&nbsp;dB dynamic range, assuming that the lowest bit does not deliver random values due to detector noise.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Temporal Integration</h3>
<div>
<p>Many FPAs integrate their input signals over some exposure time, e.g. by collecting an electric charge.
One may sometimes use rather long exposure times for sensitive detection.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Uniformity of Response</h3>
<div>
<p>The uniformity of response is often fairly good for silicon-based sensors, while substantial differences between the pixels occur for most infrared FPAs.
One may therefore need to subtract pixel-dependent offset values and also correct for the varying sensitivity of the pixels.
That is usually done with software outside the chip.
For precise measurements, one may have to regularly record the dark levels, which depends on temperature, for example.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of the Focal Plane Arrays</h2>
<div>
<p>The main application is <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> in various areas.
With a two-dimensional detector array, one can directly acquire two-dimensional images, e.g. in flash <a href="lidar.html" title="a technique for acquiring 3D images with laser pulses">LIDAR</a> devices.
Particularly widespread are silicon-based CCD and CMOS sensors, as used e.g. in <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photo cameras</a> and video cameras; they have nearly completely replaced the formerly used vidicon tubes.
Particularly advanced focal plane imaging arrays have been developed for applications in astronomy, where ultimate <a href="sensitivity.html" title="(different meanings, depending on the context)">sensitivity</a> is essential.</p>
<p>For more details, see the article on <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensors</a>.</p>
<p>Some focal plane arrays are used for <a href="spectrometers.html" title="devices for separating spectral components">spectrometers</a>.
Here, incoming light is spectrally dispersed such that each detector receives radiation only in a small spectral region.</p>
<p>Another application is in wavefront sensors, e.g. of <a href="shack_hartmann_wavefront_sensors.html" title="wavefront sensors which are based on a microlens array">Shack&ndash;Hartmann</a> type.
Here, a <a href="microlens_arrays.html" title="one- or two-dimensional arrays of microlenses, used e.g. in Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors">microlens array</a> is placed before the focal plane array, each one producing a focus on the detector plane.
The location of that focus indicates the local wavefront curvature.
One requires some dozens of detector pixels, for example, for a single pixel of the generated wavefront image.</p>
