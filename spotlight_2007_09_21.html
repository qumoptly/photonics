<p>A frequently encountered question in the context of <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>, e.g. <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a>, is what is the optimum length of the <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal</a> in terms of power conversion efficiency.
The answer is as simple as the question: it depends&hellip;</p>
<p>Consider a case with <a href="noncritical_phase_matching.html" title="a technique of phase matching which does not require a critical angular adjustment">noncritical phase matching</a> and a narrow-band <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> pump beam.
If one doubles the crystal length and wants to maintain the focusing parameter (i.e., the ratio of crystal length and <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a>), e.g. at the value of optimum focusing, one has to double the <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">mode area</a> in the crystal.
(Otherwise, the effect of <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> would increase.)
Despite the resulting decrease of optical intensity, the conversion efficiency is doubled.
So a larger length is good for efficiency, but it also increases the price as well as the sensitivity to local temperature deviations: <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase matching</a> has to be maintained over a larger length, and eventually this will become difficult, particularly in a <a href="crystal_ovens.html" title="temperature-controlled ovens for keeping optical crystals at the desired operation temperature">crystal oven</a>.
Besides, one may run into limits if the optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of the pump source is significant.</p>
<p>By using a nonlinear <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>, one can of course increase the interaction length without increasing the mode area, so that the conversion efficiency increases with the square of the waveguide length, rather than only linearly.
(We always assume that we are in the regime of low conversion, i.e. without <a href="pump_depletion.html" title="reduction in the transmitted pump power in a laser or nonlinear conversion device">pump depletion</a>.)</p>
<p>With <a href="critical_phase_matching.html" title="phase matching of a nonlinear interaction by adjustment of a propagation direction">critical phase matching</a>, the scaling properties are different.
When doubling the crystal length, one should usually double the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">mode radius</a> so as not to increase the effect of <a href="spatial_walk_off.html" title="the phenomenon that the intensity distribution of a beam in an anisotropic crystal drifts away from the direction of the wave vector">spatial walk-off</a>.
This, however, quadruples the mode area (assuming a circular pump beam), and the overall conversion efficiency stays constant.
So it doesn't help to us a longer crystal, except perhaps if one needs to operate with lower optical intensities to avoid crystal damage, or if one is prepared to work with cylindrically focused beams.</p>
<p>Still another situation is the nonlinear conversion of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>, where the <a href="group_velocity_mismatch.html" title="the phenomenon that pulses become temporally separated in a medium due to different group velocities, or (quantitatively) the difference of inverse group velocities">group velocity mismatch</a> between the different involved waves can be significant.
The crystal length is then usually chosen roughly so that the temporal walk-off equals the <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a>.
So if one doubles the pulse duration, one may use a crystal with twice the length.
This requires twice the mode area to maintain optimum focusing (assuming a bulk crystal, no waveguide, and noncritical phase matching), and for a given <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a> the <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> is reduced to one half the original value.
Overall, the conversion efficiency stays constant, i.e. independent of pulse duration.
This is why the normalized conversion efficiency is sometimes specified in &#37;/nJ (percent per nanojoule).</p>
<p>Still different situations arise for ultrashort pulses and critical phase matching; the dependence on pulse duration has been discussed in <a href="spotlight_2007_03_05.html">The Photonics Spotlight 2007-03-05</a>.</p>
<p>One can see that the answer to such a simple question requires a decent knowledge of the involved physics.
And certainly such answers should be provided before starting experiments on nonlinear frequency conversion, or buying nonlinear crystals.</p>

<p>In a high energy nanosecond laser at 532&nbsp;nm wavelength (frequency-doubled Nd:YAG), the thickness of the frequency doubling crystal is optimized for a certain pulse energy and a certain pulse duration of the infrared (IR) nanosecond pulse.
In a new configuration, the IR pulse energy is to be preserved, but the pulse duration is increased for the protection of some optical components.
For the new optimized SHG stage, do we have to use a longer or shorter crystal?</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>The increased pulse duration leads to a reduced peak power, which needs to be compensated somehow in order to maintain the nonlinear conversion efficiency.
One way would be to use stronger focusing into the crystal, but one would then lose the advantages of lower intensities for reducing the risk of optical damage.
Therefore, one may prefer to use a longer crystal.
However, the best trade-off may well depend on the particular circumstances.</p>
