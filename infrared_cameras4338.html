<p>Infrared cameras are <a href="cameras.html" title="optical instruments for recording still or moving images">cameras</a> which are sensitive to <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a>.
Cameras for different spectral regions are available, which differ substantially in terms of performance (e.g. resolution, responsivity and frame rate) and application areas.
In the following sections, we distinguish near-infrared cameras and mid- or long-wave infrared cameras.</p>
<p>Most infrared cameras have a two-dimensional <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensor</a> which delivers digital data through some electronic interface, for example of USB, Camera Link or LAN type.
However, some special cameras have a line sensor, i.e., only a one-dimensional image sensor; those are often used for continuous imaging of moving items e.g. in production lines and in <a href="laser_scanners.html" title="devices for scanning the direction of a laser beam">laser scanners</a>.</p>
<p>Infrared cameras may or may not be sensitive to visible and <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> light.
Often, they include an <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filter</a> which transmits only infrared light, so that sensitivity to unwanted wavelengths is avoided.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Colorful images do not necessarily indicate spectral information!</aside>
<p>Typically, infrared cameras do not provide spectral information, but only intensity values for their pixels.
This is in contrast to <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photo cameras</a>, for example.
When colorful images from infrared cameras are presented, these usually contain false colors, which only encode intensity values.
However, there are also infrared cameras for <a href="multispectral_imaging.html" title="imaging which provides images with multiple spectral channels">multispectral imaging</a> or <a href="hyperspectral_imaging.html" title="imaging which provides images with an optical spectrum corresponding to each pixel">hyperspectral imaging</a>, which typically require a more sophisticated setup, e.g. with dispersive optics and a line scanner.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Near-infrared Cameras</h2>
<div>
<p>The usual type of CCD and CMOS image sensors for visible light are based on silicon, and these have some sensitivity up to optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> somewhere between 1000&nbsp;nm and 1100&nbsp;nm.
Although this is already in the infrared, a real infrared camera often contains a sensor chip based on a indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), which provides a good <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> roughly in the wavelength region from 900&nbsp;nm to 1700&nbsp;nm.
Compared with silicon-based sensors, these are substantially more expensive and typically provide lower resolution &ndash; often only a few hundred pixels in the horizontal and vertical direction, i.e., well below one megapixel overall.</p>
<p>Due to the smaller <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a> of InGaAs, optimum performance in terms of <a href="dark_current.html" title="a current from a photodetector which occurs even in the absence of a light input">dark current</a> and noise is achieved only at low temperatures; therefore, such as sensor chips are often equipped with a thermoelectric (Peltier) cooler.
Unfortunately, that substantially increases the electricity consumption, and the housing often needs to be optimized in terms of heat dissipation, e.g. with cooling fins.</p>
<p>The required <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> optics do not substantially differ from those for visible cameras, since it is not difficult to find <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">optical glasses</a> with high transmission in that wavelength region.
Essentially, one only requires adapted <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coatings</a> and <a href="achromatic_optics.html" title="optical devices or setups with minimized chromatic aberrations">achromatic</a> lenses.</p>
<p>Near-infrared cameras are often used for inspection purposes.
For example, they are used for the inspection of semiconductor wafers, solar cells and various other industrial products, also for agricultural goods like wheat and fruit.
Laser <a href="beam_profilers.html" title="devices for measuring the intensity profile of a laser beam">beam profilers</a> are another example.</p>
<p>Near-infrared cameras can also provide <a href="night_vision_devices.html" title="instruments which allow viewing or imaging under conditions of very low light levels">night vision</a> in conjunction with some infrared illumination.
It can be beneficial for surveillance purposes to work only with invisible illumination light, although that might relatively easily be detected.
As long as substantial exposure times are acceptable, such cameras can work with rather low infrared light levels.</p>
<p>For <a href="thermal_imaging.html" title="imaging based on thermal radiation">thermal imaging</a> around or below room temperature, the near-infrared spectral range is not suitable; for that, one requires mid-infrared cameras (see below), which can register lower-energy <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Mid- and Long-wave Infrared Cameras</h2>
<div>
<p>Mostly for <a href="thermal_imaging.html" title="imaging based on thermal radiation">thermal imaging</a> (thermography) applications, mid-infrared cameras are used, which can respond to substantially longer optical wavelengths &ndash; sometimes well beyond 10&nbsp;&mu;m.
It is then possible, for example, to obtain temperature maps of buildings in order to identify locations with excessive heat losses; that must work even at winter temperatures of below 0&thinsp;&deg;C, where thermal emission is rather low.
There is a range of other applications, for example involving medical diagnosis, nondestructive testing, fire detection, satellite-based weather profile monitoring, air pollution monitoring and deforestation mapping, apart from military applications like passive infrared surveillance and heat-seeking missiles.</p>
<p>Spectral regions of special interest are the <em>atmospheric windows</em> at approximately 3 to 5&nbsp;&mu;m (the mid-wave infrared window, MWIR) and from 8 to 12&nbsp;&mu;m (long-wave window, LWIR).
Here, atmospheric transmission is relatively high, while there is strong infrared absorption in other wavelength regions.</p>
<p>For such long wavelengths, special <a href="infrared_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems which are suitable for infrared light">infrared optics</a> are required.
Unfortunately, that substantially contributes to the cost of long-wavelength infrared cameras.
The imaging performance of such optics is also usually not great, but that may not matter since the resolution of the required <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensors</a> is anyway quite moderate.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Cooled Infrared Photodetectors</h3>
<div>
<p>Semiconductor photodetectors for such long wavelengths, corresponding to very low <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> energies, have to have a very small bandgap energy.
Suitable materials are for example mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe, MCT) (suitable even well beyond 10&nbsp;&mu;m) and indium antimonide (InSb, up to &approx;5.5&nbsp;&mu;m).
Similarly, there are <a href="focal_plane_arrays.html" title="arrays of light detectors placed in the focal plane of an imaging system">focal plane arrays</a> based on quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs).
The small bandgap energy also makes them very sensitive to thermal excitation within the sensor itself.
Therefore, such <a href="infrared_detectors.html" title="detectors for infrared light">infrared detectors</a> often need to be strongly cooled during operation &ndash; often to 100 kelvins or even substantially below.</p>
<p>Cooling to the order of 100&nbsp;K can be done relatively easily with a Stirling cooler, which is essentially a Stirling engine driven with an electric motor.
It may take a couple of minutes after switching the device on until the required operation temperature is achieved.
The cooled detector must be well insulated against the environment, also for preventing the deposition of ice, and is often placed in a vacuum-sealed case.</p>
<p>Their technology with infrared optics, a special long-wavelength image sensor and a cooling arrangement makes cooled infrared cameras quite expensive, but their performance is better than that of uncooled detectors as described in the following section.
The substantial weight, electricity consumption and preparation time are of course practical disadvantages.</p>
<p>For more details, see the article on <a href="photoconductive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which exhibit a reduction in electrical resistance caused by incoming light">photoconductive detectors</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Thermal Detectors</h3>
<div>
<p>Many long-wavelength infrared cameras do not contain a semiconductor detector based on the internal photo effect, but rather a kind of <a href="thermal_detectors.html" title="light detectors which are based on measuring light-induced temperature rises">thermal detector</a>, which responds to a temperature increase caused by <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> of incoming infrared light.
Such thermal detectors can be based on different technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequently, one uses bolometers in the form of <em>microbolometers</em>, with which some number of pixels (e.g. 160 &times; 120, 320 &times; 240, 640 &times; 480 or 1024 &times; 768) can be realized on a sensor chip.
As the sensing element, each pixel contains a thin infrared-absorbing plate, made e.g. of amorphous silicon (aSi) or vanadium oxide, which is suspended above the chip (with a small air gap between plate and chip) with two electrodes.
One can then measure the temperature-dependent electrical resistance of the plate, which decreases with increasing temperature.
Note that without incoming infrared light the temperature of the plate will relax towards the substrate temperature, while external radiation will increase the temperature.
The readings will thus have to be corrected according to the substrate temperature, if that is not held constant.
A metal mirror below the plate may be used to back-reflect non-absorbed infrared light and at the same time to reduce the thermal radiation from the substrate.</li>
<li>There are <a href="pyroelectric_detectors.html" title="light detectors based on the pyroelectric effect"><em>pyroelectric</em></a> materials such as lithium tantalate, generating a small electric voltage in response to a temperature gradient.
That temperature gradient results from the heating by incident radiation; the generated heat is conducted to some substrate, and the temperature gradient is proportional to the incident intensity.
Such detectors are AC-coupled, i.e., they can be used only to monitor changes, but not constant temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such detectors may still be cooled to some extent in order to improve their noise performance, but fundamentally such cooling is not required.
Often, they are temperature-stabilized, i.e., the operation temperature is kept constant, typically with a small Peltier cooler, but not at a particularly low temperature.</p>
<p>For more details, see the articles on <a href="thermal_detectors.html" title="light detectors which are based on measuring light-induced temperature rises">thermal detectors</a> and <a href="pyroelectric_detectors.html" title="light detectors based on the pyroelectric effect">pyroelectric detectors</a>.</p>

<div class="comment">
<p class="comment_details">2020-05-27</p>
<p>You state a gross MISNOMER. There are NO infrared &ldquo;cameras&rdquo;. They are &ldquo;imagers&rdquo;.
Camera implies that there is a chamber (camera in Italian).
These imagers do not have a chamber but have a focal point array detector that converts the temperature signals electronically to a colorized map. </p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>Usually, a camera is just considered to be an imaging instrument.
The earliest camera &ndash; the camera obscura &ndash; indeed contained a chamber, which led to the origin of that term.
Modern cameras usually use a lens instead of a pinhole, but otherwise also have kind of chamber.
I am not sure whether one should prohibit the use of the term <em>camera</em> in case of any devices not containing such a chamber &ndash; or whether some authority has determined to do so.
(It happens quite often that such details of the original instrument are not so seriously considered later on.)</p>
<p>Anyway, many infrared imaging devices do contain some kind of chamber (I mean empty space e.g. between a kind of lens and the detector), even though it might be much smaller than in the original camera obscura.
At least for the mentioned near-infrared cameras, there is no doubt that the chamber required by you exists, and in other cases there may be some space at least between a filter or protection glass and the actual sensor..
Therefore, the statement &ldquo;there are no infrared cameras&rdquo; is definitely wrong.</p>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
</ul>
