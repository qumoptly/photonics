A common opto-isolator contains an LED and a bipolar phototransistor.

</figure>
<p>Opto-isolators, also called optocouplers or photocouplers, are <a href="optoelectronics.html" title="the technology of electronic devices that interact with light">optoelectronic</a> components which can be used to transmit analog or digital electrical signals between two electrical circuits while providing electrical isolation.
An opto-isolator is normally provided in a compact package, e.g. of dual in-line type, as otherwise also used for small electronic components such as operational amplifiers.</p>
<p>Similar functions are often obtained with transformers, which however cannot transmit DC signals and are typically substantially larger and more heavy than opto-isolators.</p>
<p>Even though the term <em>optical isolators</em> is sometimes used, such devices must not be confused with optical isolators like <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolators</a>, which allow light transmission in one direction only.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Operation Principle and Variants</h2>
<div>
<p>The operation principle of an opto-isolator is to convert an electrical signal to an optical signal, transmit that light signal and to convert it back into an electrical signal.
Of course, one chooses an emitter which well matches the <a href="spectral_response_of_a_photodetector.html" title="the range of optical wavelengths for which a photodetector is sensitive">spectral response</a> of the receiver.
Typically, one uses an infrared <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diode</a> (LED, usually GaAs-based) and a silicon <a href="phototransistors.html" title="a type of semiconductor-based photodetector with internal current amplification for higher responsivity">phototransistor</a>.
Those are mounted in a distance of a few millimeters, for example, within an opaque package.</p>
<p>There are also isolators with other kinds of receivers, for example <a href="photoconductive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which exhibit a reduction in electrical resistance caused by incoming light">photoresistors</a> (which are largely outdated) or <a href="p_i_n_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with a p&ndash;i&ndash;n semiconductor structure">p&ndash;i&ndash;n photodiodes</a>, or with Darlington phototransistors for a particularly high current transfer your ratio (see below).
Early devices used an <a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">incandescent lamp</a> as transmitter.</p>
<p>There are even devices containing a triac; the output then remains switched on even when the input signal disappears, until the output current is interrupted in other ways.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">There are opto-isolators with integrated driver circuits for transmitter and receiver.</aside>
<p>Simple isolators contain only the LED and a phototransistor, for example (see Figure&nbsp;1), and no additional electronics.
Others contain a complete receiver circuit, which requires some constant operation voltage and supplies an output voltage signal.
Similarly, some devices contain a driver circuit which receives an input voltage signal.</p>
<p>A special form is the <em>solid-state relay</em>, which is explicitly used for switching a load, somewhat similar to a conventional relay based on a magnetically actuated mechanical switch; the receiver may contain one or two MOSFETs (a special kind of transistors).</p>
<p>Of course, the electrical integration must be done according to the type and specifications of the particular isolator used.
There are substantial differences between different isolators.
For example, devices with <a href="photoconductive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which exhibit a reduction in electrical resistance caused by incoming light">photoresistors</a> can be used with arbitrary polarity, while those with photodiodes or phototransistors can not.</p>
<p>There are also <em>bidirectional opto-isolators</em>.
In principle, one may realize such a device based on two LEDs, where each one reacts to light of the other one.
However, much better performance is achieved by using one opto-isolator for each direction, which may be integrated into a common package.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The type of optical coupling depends on the required isolation voltage.</aside>
<p>The optical coupling between transmitter and receiver can be done in different ways.
For example, one may just mount the transmitter close to the receiver to avoid substantial losses of light.
For improved isolation, one can insert some dielectric material between them.
One may also use a reflecting silicone dome or a kind of multimode <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>.
Particularly for high isolation voltages, one may prefer to use a relatively long waveguide, perhaps even a long <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">optical fiber</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Device Parameters</h2>
<div>
<p>Essential parameters of an opto-isolator are:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Typically, the maximum photocurrent is limited by the drive current. Very different values of the current transfer ratio are possible.</aside>
<ul>
<li>One requires a certain <em>input current</em> to the LED.
This is not a fixed value, however: it depends on how much <a href="photocurrent.html" title="an electric current which is induced by incident light in a photodetector">photocurrent</a> is required on the receiver side, particularly for the common devices based on an LED and a phototransistor: the maximum photocurrent is proportional to the optical power, which itself is proportional to the LED drive current.
Therefore, apart from a <em>maximum allowed input current</em> manufacturers specify a <em>current transfer ratio</em>, which is the ratio of photocurrent to the drive current.
The current transfer ratio depends on the efficiency of the emitter, the efficiency of the light transfer to the receiver, and on the <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> of the receiver.
Opto-isolators differ very much in that respect; while some have values well below 1&#37;, others (with a phototransistor and efficient light coupling) can have ratios above 5 (= 500&#37;).</li>
<li>Such a device has a certain specified <em>isolation voltage</em>, i.e., a maximum allowed voltage between transmitter and receiver, which is often a couple of kilovolts.
For operation with higher voltages, an electrical breakdown may occur, which would typically destroy the device.</li>
<li>The operation <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range"><em>bandwidth</em></a> can easily be in the megahertz region, sometimes even above 1&nbsp;GHz.
The fastest response is obtained with <a href="p_i_n_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with a p&ndash;i&ndash;n semiconductor structure">p&ndash;i&ndash;n photodiodes</a>.
Phototransistors are typically slower than photodiodes.</li>
<li>Typically, the relation between photocurrent and input drive current is fairly <em>linear</em> over a substantial range.
(To exploit that linearity, one may need a driver circuit which provides an output current proportional to its input voltage.)
However, some devices are meant to be for digital signals, where linearity is no relevant aspect.</li>

<h2>Business Disputes</h2>
<p>Occasionally, serious disputes arise, e.g. when a company purchases a laser from some supplier. Conflicting views may occur concerning questions as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the <a href="./beam_quality.html?banner=arbitration">beam quality</a> consistent with the somewhat vague specifications?</li>
<li>Is it normal that the laser pulses exhibit substantial <a href="./timing_jitter.html?banner=arbitration">timing jitter</a>?</li>
<li>Should it be considered as acceptable that the laser stays within specifications only if its alignment is optimized quite often by the user?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mediation</h3>
<p>Going to court is usually the last thing you want to do &ndash; but how else to resolve a conflict?</p>
<p>Mediation is a much more attractive approach. Only, you need to find a mediator</p>
<ul>
<li>who fully understands the technical matters, and</li>
<li>who can be trusted to be impartial and fair.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./paschotta.html?banner=arbitration">Dr. Paschotta</a> from RP Photonics offers such services. Your chance is to reach a fair resolution with far less time and money than at court.</p>
