<p>The simplest kind of wave is a <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> <a href="plane_waves.html" title="waves with plane wavefronts">plane wave</a>, described by the following complex wave amplitude, being a function of spatial position <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> and time <span class="eqn_il"><i>t</i></span>:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/plane_wave.gif" width="198" height="32" alt="plane wave"></div>
<p>with the <a href="wave_vector.html" title="a vector indicating the direction of wave propagation and the phase delay per unit length">wave vector</a>, the magnitude of which is the <a href="wavenumber.html" title="the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumber</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span>, and the angular <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">frequency</a> <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&omega;</span></span>.
The wavenumber determines the wavelength, defined as the spatial period of the wave (e.g., the distance between subsequent oscillation maxima, see Figure&nbsp;1):</p>

A plane wave, with the wavelength illustrated with the black ruler in the middle.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(Note that in <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a> the <a href="wavenumber.html" title="the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumber</a> is normally considered as the inverse of the wavelength, not involving the factor <span class="eqn_il">2&thinsp;<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>.)</p>
<p>When propagating by one wavelength in <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> direction, the plane wave acquires a <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> delay of <span class="eqn_il">2&thinsp;<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>.</p>
<p>Wavelength and <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">frequency</a> are related to each other: as the wave propagates by one wavelength within one oscillation cycle, its <a href="phase_velocity.html" title="the velocity with which phase fronts propagate in a medium">phase velocity</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>c</i></span> is given by:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/plane_wave_c.gif" width="98" height="18" alt="phase velocity"></div>
<p>For wave packets, there is another kind of velocity, called the <a href="group_velocity.html" title="the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium">group velocity</a>, which can deviate from the phase velocity if there is <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>, i.e., a dependence of the phase velocity on the frequency.</p>
<p>Note that for waves with a different spatial distribution &ndash; for example, for strongly focused <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>, the amplitude is a function of position is in general not (or not exactly) periodic, and the spacing between subsequent wave maxima may somewhat deviate from the wavelength, which is always defined for a plane wave.
See also the article on the <a href="gouy_phase_shift.html" title="an additional phase shift occurring in the propagation of focused Gaussian beams">Gouy phase shift</a>, which is essentially a phase deviation of <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a> against a plane wave for comparison.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Wavelengths and Colors</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">Monochromatic light</a> is seen with a certain color depending on its wavelength.
Unfortunately, a computer screen cannot produce monochromatic light, but only roughly approximate the visual impression for certain wavelength.
This has been done in Figure&nbsp;1, which will appear somewhat differently on different computer screens.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Waves: Vacuum Wavelength and the Wavelength in a Medium</h2>
<div>
<p>If a <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> optical wave subsequently propagates through different transparent media, its wavelength will vary, while its <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a> <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&nu;</span></span> stays constant.
Therefore, it would be most natural to characterize such a wave by its optical frequency.
For historical reasons, it is more common, however, to characterize optical waves (<a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a>) with their <em>vacuum wavelength</em>, i.e., the wavelength which would occur for propagation through vacuum.
Its value is close to the wavelength in air, since air, having a very low density, has only a week influence on the velocity of light; its <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> is only very slightly above 1.</p>
<p>The output wavelength of a <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">quasi-monochromatic</a> light source (e.g., a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>) is always understood to be a vacuum wavelength.
The wavelength in air is only so slightly smaller that this deviation is not relevant for most applications.</p>
<p>For a given vacuum wavelength <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span><sub>0</sub></span>, the wavelength in a medium with <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>n</i></span> is <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span>&thinsp;0&thinsp;<span class="greek">&lambda;</span><sub>0</sub>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>n</i></span>.
Generally, the refractive index depends on the <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a> or vacuum wavelength (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>).</p>
<p>For visible light, the vacuum wavelength is roughly between 400&nbsp;nm and 700&nbsp;nm; there are no precisely defined boundaries of the visible spectral region, since the sensitivity of the human eye is a smooth function of wavelength and also differs between individuals.
Light with longer vacuum wavelengths is called <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a>, while light with shorter wavelengths is <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>.</p>
<p>If some physical quantity depends on an optical frequency, it is very often called wavelength-dependent instead of frequency-dependent, even if the spatial aspect does not play a role in the relevant phenomena.</p>
<p>Also one often specifies an optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> (e.g., the <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> of a laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>) in terms of the width of the wavelength range rather than the frequency range.
For the conversion between wavelength and frequency ranges one needs to keep in mind that the width of a frequency interval does not only depend on the width of the corresponding wavelength interval but also on the mean wavelength: <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&delta;</span><span class="greek">&nu;</span>&thinsp;=&thinsp;(<i>c</i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<span class="greek">&lambda;</span><sup>2</sup>)&thinsp;<span class="greek">&delta;</span><span class="greek">&lambda;</span></span> (assuming small intervals).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Measurement of Optical Wavelengths</h2>
<div>
<p>Optical wavelengths can be measured with <a href="wavemeters.html" title="devices for precise measurements of laser wavelengths">wavemeters</a>, which are a kind of <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a>.
The indirect evaluation of the wavelength from a measured optical frequency and the vacuum <a href="velocity_of_light.html" title="the velocity with which light propagates in a medium">velocity of light</a> can be far more precise, since optical frequencies can be measured with extremely high precision, and the vacuum velocity of light is nowadays (in the SI system) a defined quantity, i.e., without any measurement error.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Wavelength Standards</h2>
<div>
<p>It is common to use certain <a href="spectral_lamps.html" title="low pressure gas discharge lamps emitting light on one or more standard spectral lines">spectral lamps</a> as reasonably accurate wavelength standards.
Besides, there are <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules">optical frequency standards</a> relying on far more sophisticated technology, where the obtained wavelength is by many orders of magnitude more precise.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Non-monochromatic Light</h2>
<div>
<p>In many cases, light is not monochromatic, but rather exhibits a substantial optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
It is then often of interest to determine how the optical power is distributed over different wavelengths or optical frequencies.
This can be accomplished with <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> analyzers, ideally delivering a precisely defined <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> (PSD) versus wavelength of frequency.
The units of such a quantity can be W/nm or W/THz, for example.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Importance of Optical Wavelengths</h2>
<div>
<p>The wavelength of light is relevant for a large number of phenomena.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The longer the wavelength of light, the stronger is its tendency for <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a>, i.e., for the expansion of a light beam (e.g., a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>).
Because optical wavelength are so short, <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited beams</a>, as are emitted by many <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>, can exhibit a rather small <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, i.e., propagate over substantial distances without substantial increase in beam area.
Wavelengths are also relevant in other diffraction phenomena, e.g. at <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a>.</li>
<li>The wavelength is an essential quantity for any <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> phenomena.
Because optical wavelengths are rather short, optical <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a> usually require very high mechanical stability, since even sub-micrometer changes of propagation lengths can substantially modify interference conditions.</li>
<li>Many optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> can have substantial effects only if <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase matching</a> is achieved.
The phase-matching conditions contain the wavelengths of the involved optical beams, and not just the optical frequencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many other cases, the actually irrelevant quantity is the <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>, which of course is related to the wavelength.
For example, resonant effects in the <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">optical pumping</a> of laser-active ions cause strong frequency dependencies.
The wavelengths themselves, being far larger than atoms or ions, are not relevant for those.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Special Types of Wavelengths</h2>
<div>
<p>In optics and <a href="photonics.html" title="the science and technology of light">photonics</a>, there are many different terms involving the word &ldquo;wavelength&rdquo;.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>emission wavelength</em> of a light source is the vacuum wavelength of the emitted light.</li>
<li>The <em>Bragg wavelength</em> of a <a href="bragg_mirrors.html" title="mirror structures based on Bragg reflection at a period structure">Bragg mirror</a> is the vacuum wavelength for which that mirror has the highest reflectivity.</li>
<li>The <a href="cut_off_wavelength.html" title="a wavelength above which a guided mode of a waveguide ceases to exist"><em>cut-off wavelength</em></a> of a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> is the vacuum wavelength above which a guided mode ceases to exist.</li>
<li>The <a href="zero_dispersion_wavelength.html" title="a wavelength where the group delay dispersion of a fiber or a material is zero"><em>zero dispersion wavelength</em></a> is the vacuum wavelength where the <a href="group_velocity_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the group velocity in a medium, or (quantitatively) the derivative of the inverse group velocity with respect to angular frequency">group velocity dispersion</a> often optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> vanishes.</li>
<li><a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator"><em>Wavelength tuning</em></a> means the modification of the emission wavelength (optical frequency) of a laser, for example.</li>
<li><a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain"><em>Wavelength division multiplexing</em></a> is a multiplexing technique operating in the time domain, often used in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>.</li>

<h2>Numerical Modeling</h2>
<p>Developing devices or systems in photonics requires a <b>comprehensive quantitative understanding</b> &ndash; otherwise, it becomes inefficient, waisting time and money.</p>
<p><a href="./laser_modeling.html?banner=numerical_modeling">Numerical modeling</a> is often the most efficient way towards results:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand <em>quantitatively</em> what is going on</li>
<li>check the influence of design changes or possible detrimental effects</li>
<li>understand strange experimental observations</li>
<li>find optimized designs more reliably and faster</li>
</ul>
