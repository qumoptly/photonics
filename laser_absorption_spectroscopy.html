</header>
<p>There is a range of methods called <em>laser absorption spectroscopy</em>, where <a href="laser_light.html" title="light generated with a laser device">laser light</a> is used to precisely measure <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> features of substances.
The purpose of such kinds of <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a> is frequently to find out details on such substances, but in other cases one utilizes known details of substances for other purposes.
For example, laser absorption spectroscopy is often used for realizing <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules">optical frequency standards</a>, e.g. by <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">stabilizing the wavelengths of a laser</a> to a precisely defined absorption transition.
See below for further details on applications.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Principles of Laser Absorption Spectroscopy</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Direct Absorption Spectroscopy</h3>
<div>
<p>A frequently used method involves that a <a href="tunable_lasers.html" title="lasers the output wavelengths of which can be tuned">tunable</a> <a href="narrow_linewidth_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers with a narrow optical emission spectrum">narrow-linewidth laser</a> (frequently a <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency laser</a>) is tuned through some wavelength range, and the <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> absorption in some sample is measured as a function of that wavelength.
The absorption is often obtained by measuring (a) the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> of a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> which is transmitted through the investigated medium and (b) the optical power of a reference beam (obtained with a <a href="beam_splitters.html" title="devices for splitting a laser beam into two or more beams">beam splitter</a> between the laser and the investigated medium), which is not affected by the medium.
That way, one can largely avoid that power fluctuations of the laser (<a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a>) affect the results.
In many cases, one uses a balanced <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a>, essentially measuring the difference between two optical powers (rather than their ratio).</p>
<p>Obviously, the obtained spectral resolution is limited by the laser <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a>, which is therefore often minimized with suitable <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser designs</a>.
Extremely high precision is required in the area of optical <a href="frequency_metrology.html" title="the field of technology dealing with precise frequency measurements">frequency metrology</a>, e.g. for realizing extremely precise <a href="optical_clocks.html" title="time measurement devices based on optical frequency standards">optical clocks</a>.
However, direct absorption measurements are subject to low-frequency laser noise and therefore limited in terms of sensitivity; substantial improvements are possible with modulation spectroscopy (see below).</p>
<p>In some cases, a laser wavelength is swept through a certain range very rapidly (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="wavelength_swept_lasers.html" title="lasers which allow for period and fast wavelength tuning"><em>wavelength-swept lasers</em></a>) for rapid acquisition of absorption spectra.
However, the achievable spectral resolution is ultimately limited by the interaction time.
Therefore, highly precise measurements often require very slow tuning of the laser.</p>
<p>In some cases, relatively inexpensive <a href="tunable_lasers.html" title="lasers the output wavelengths of which can be tuned">tunable</a> <a href="diode_lasers.html" title="semiconductor laser devices based on laser diodes">diode laser</a>, often in the from of <a href="external_cavity_diode_lasers.html" title="non-monolithic diode lasers where the laser cavity (resonator) is completed with external optical elements">external cavity diode lasers</a> (ECDL), can be used (<em>tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy</em>, TDLAS).
In other cases, substantially more sophisticated laser sources are required, which e.g. can provide far lower <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidths</a> and/or larger tuning ranges.</p>
<p>See also the article on <a href="laser_spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of laser light with matter is utilized">laser spectroscopy</a>, which gives an overview on laser types used in spectroscopy.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Setups with Long Propagation Lengths</h3>
<div>
<p>For highly sensitive detection e.g. of substances in air or other gases, it is necessary to have a substantially long propagation length of light in the gas.
Therefore, various types of <a href="multipass_gas_cells.html" title="a cell which allows to realize multiple passes of a laser beam through a gas">multipass gas cells</a> (e.g. of Pfund, White or Herriott type) has been developed, where a light beam (typically a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>) propagates through the cell many times.
That way, long propagation lengths in the gas can be obtained even with a compact optical setup.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Cavity-enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy</h3>
<div>
<p>Effectively increased propagation lengths can also be achieved by placing a sample inside an <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonator</a> (cavity).
Resonators with high <a href="q_factor.html" title="a measure of the damping of resonator modes">Q factor</a> (high <a href="finesse.html" title="the free spectral range divided by the FWHM width of the resonances of an optical resonator">finesse</a>) allow for substantially improved sensitivities.</p>
<p>One possibility is <em>continuous-wave cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy</em>, where the optical resonator stays tuned during frequency sweeps of the laser source.
The synchronization of laser and resonator may be achieved with an electronic feedback loop or with passive locking techniques, using optical feedback from the resonator to the laser.</p>
<p>Another method is <em>cavity ring-down spectroscopy</em>, where light is injected in the form of a short <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a>, and one measures the decay time of light for different cavity lengths, corresponding to different optical frequencies.
It is also possible to do such measurements with multiple cavity modes simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Intracavity Laser Absorption Spectroscopy</h3>
<div>
<p>Absorption measurements with particularly high sensitivity can be achieved with <a href="intracavity_laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="a method of laser spectroscopy, based on the evolution of the optical spectrum of intracavity radiation under the influence of narrowband absorption features">intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy</a>, where a sample is placed inside a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.
Typically, one records the laser output spectrum at a certain time after turning the pump source on.
The laser would normally exhibit broadband emission with a smooth spectrum, but absorption lines create dips in the spectrum.
Due to the large number of resonator roundtrips within the build-up time of radiation in the laser, the method can be very sensitive.</p>
<p>See the article on <a href="intracavity_laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="a method of laser spectroscopy, based on the evolution of the optical spectrum of intracavity radiation under the influence of narrowband absorption features">intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Frequency Modulation Spectroscopy</h3>
<div>
<p>Absorption features are not always directly investigated by measuring wavelength-dependent absorption, as explained in the section on direct laser absorption spectroscopy.
Instead, one may employ <em>frequency modulation spectroscopy</em> (also called <em>wavelength modulation spectroscopy</em>) [4], where one uses a frequency-modulated laser source.
Due to the frequency-dependent absorption, the absorption of the frequency-modulated beam becomes time-dependent, so that a power modulation of the transmitted beam can be detected e.g. with a <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a>.
Typically, one does not simply measure the magnitude of the induced power modulation, but rather processes the <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> signal in an electronic mixer together with the modulation signal.</p>
<p>The optical frequency modulation is in some cases directly obtained by modulating the laser; for example, a <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> exhibits a frequency modulation (together with an amplitude modulation) when its drive current is modulated.
In other cases, one uses an <a href="electro_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic modulator</a> as a <a href="phase_modulators.html" title="devices for manipulating the phase of a laser beam">phase modulator</a> in conjunction with a continuously emitting laser (often a <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency laser</a>).</p>
<p>Frequency modulation spectroscopy generally allows for substantially higher sensitivities than direct absorption spectroscopy, essentially because the <a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a> limiting the sensitivity is noise around the modulation frequency, rather than around zero frequency.
Note that laser noise is usually strong at low frequencies but decays strongly at higher noise frequencies.</p>
<p>Frequency modulation spectroscopy can also be combined with cavity-enhanced methods.
For example, for ultra-sensitive measurements one may use an <a href="enhancement_cavities.html" title="optical cavities for exploiting the resonant enhancement of the power of circulating light">enhancement cavity</a> and a modulation frequency which matches the <a href="free_spectral_range.html" title="frequency spacing of the axial modes of an optical resonator">free spectral range</a> of that cavity [8].</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Two-photon Absorption Spectroscopy</h3>
<div>
<p>There are cases where laser absorption spectroscopy is not utilizing ordinary linear absorption, but instead <a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">two-photon absorption</a> &ndash; a process where two <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a> are simultaneously absorbed, exciting a single atom or ion.
The following aspects are relevant for understanding the benefits of that technique:</p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, it is beneficial that optical transitions with relatively high energy differences can be probed without realizing <a href="ultraviolet_lasers.html" title="lasers (or other laser-based light sources) generating ultraviolet light">ultraviolet lasers</a> emitting a very short wavelengths.</li>
<li>One may investigate transitions which are not possible with electric dipole interactions.
This is typical for extremely narrow <a href="forbidden_transitions.html" title="transitions between different energy levels of some atoms or ions for which dipole transitions are suppressed via symmetries">forbidden transitions</a>, which are particularly interesting for precision measurements.</li>
<li>Two-photon absorption can be Doppler-free, i.e., not affected by the random movement of atoms or ions in a gas cell, if the absorption process involves two counter-propagating photons.
The Doppler frequency shifts for both photons are then opposite to each other, so that they cancel out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such techniques have e.g. been applied for measuring the frequency of the 1S&ndash;2S transition in atomic hydrogen with an extremely high precision [14].</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Absorption Spectroscopy on Molecular Gases</h2>
<div>
<p>Various aspects of absorption spectroscopy on gases have already been covered above, but some additional remarks are appropriate.</p>
<p>When laser absorption spectroscopy is done on molecular gases, one can identify different species through their different absorption lines (<em>molecular finger prints</em>).
This can be used e.g. for detecting trace gases and measuring their concentrations in the atmosphere.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Spectral Regions</h3>
<div>
<p>One has to decide on the used spectral region:</p>
<ul>
<li>The highest sensitivities are possible when using <a href="mid_infrared_laser_sources.html" title="light sources emitting mid-infrared radiation in the form of a laser-like beam">mid-infrared laser sources</a>, because the strongest absorption lines are usually in that spectral region.
The optical frequencies directly correspond to vibration or rotation modes of molecules.
Unfortunately, mid-infrared sources are relatively difficult to make, thus expensive and limited in performance.</li>
<li>Alternatively, one may work in the near-infrared spectral region, where laser sources are substantially less expensive and often also exhibit higher performance.
In that case, one has to use <em>overtone transitions</em>, with optical frequencies which are integer multiples of molecular vibration frequencies.
As these transitions are much weaker, the achievable sensitivity is lower.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Doppler-free Spectroscopy</h3>
<div>
<p>A fundamental challenge in the spectroscopy of gases is the thermal movement of the gas molecules, which causes Doppler broadening of the optical transitions &ndash; often going far beyond the natural linewidth.
However, there are various techniques of <em>Doppler-free laser spectroscopy</em>, where such effects are eliminated.
As already mentioned above, two-photon absorption spectroscopy has that potential, but there are also other methods, and particular <em>saturated absorption spectroscopy</em> (or <em>saturation spectroscopy</em>) as explained in the following.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Saturation spectroscopy allows one to overcome the Doppler broadening.</aside>
<p>If gas atoms (or molecules) are exposed to a narrow-band laser beam which is tuned to an absorption transition, only those atoms will be excited for which the Doppler shift makes them resonant with the laser beam.
For example, if the optical frequency of the pump laser is on the lower end of the Doppler-broadened absorption line, essentially only those atoms will interact with it which are moving towards the pump light with an appropriate velocity.
Similarly, a counter-propagating probe beam with the same optical frequency can interact only with atoms moving in the opposite direction.
Therefore, the pump beam has virtually no influence on the absorption probed with the probe beam.
This changes, however, when the frequency of both beams is tuned to the line center, so that they interact with the same atoms: the absorption for the probe beam is then somewhat saturated (reduced) if the pump beam is sufficiently intense.
Therefore, one can detect a narrow dip in the middle of the absorption line as recorded with the appropriate beam.
The width of that dip is determined by the natural linewidth, which can be much smaller than the Doppler-broadened linewidth.</p>
<p>Another possibility is Doppler-free <a href="fourier_transform_spectroscopy.html" title="a method for spectroscopy rare an optical spectrum is computed from raw data with a Fourier transform">Fourier transform spectroscopy</a> [16] involving two <a href="frequency_combs.html" title="optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines">frequency combs</a> with slightly different comb line spacings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of Laser Absorption Spectroscopy</h2>
<div>
<p>Methods of laser absorption spectroscopy are often used for detecting the composition of materials, often including quantitative measurements of concentrations.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concentrations of trace gases in the atmosphere are measured e.g. with laser radar (<a href="lidar.html" title="a technique for acquiring 3D images with laser pulses">LIDAR</a>) methods in the context of environmental monitoring.
Similarly, pollutants can be detected in water, and concentrations of medically active substances can be measured.
The <a href="beer_lambert_law.html" title="a relation for the dependence of absorption coefficients on concentrations">Beer&ndash;Lambert law</a> can be used to related measured absorption coefficients to concentrations of substances.</li>
<li>Biology, medicine and chemistry can profit from precise and rapid methods of material analysis, which are partly non-destructive.
For example, by measuring concentrations of various substances in human breath, one may retrieve vital information on medical conditions.</li>
<li>Combustion processes, for example in combustion engines, can be monitored with laser spectroscopy.
One may learn about the chemical composition and the gas temperatures, both with sufficiently high temporal resolution.</li>
<li>Security applications include the detection of explosives and drugs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Short-term Software Licenses Available</h2>
<p>Do you need simulation software (such as our <a href="./fiberpower.html?banner=rented_software">RP Fiber Power</a>) only during a <b>short-term project</b>?</p>
<p>Or do you want to <b>test such software very thoroughly</b> before fully committing to it?</p>
<p>RP Photonics is now offering a solution: <a href="./software_licenses.html?banner=rented_software">software licenses</a> which are valid for a <b>limited time</b>.</p>
<p>Our conditions are very fair:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay only 5% of the amount for a permanent license for one month.</li>
<li>When switching over to a permanent license directly thereafter, get the already paid money fully deducted!</li>
<li>If you decide for that only later on, still get two thirds deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are confident that you will like our software and finally decide for permanent licenses.</p>
