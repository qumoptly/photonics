</header>
<p>The field of view of a <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescope</a> or a <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photo camera</a>, for example, is usually understood as the range of angular directions in which objects can be observed for a fixed orientation of the instrument.
(One may of course observe a wider range by combining images from different instrument orientations.)
It can be quantified in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>One may specify the full angle (or half angle) of view in the horizontal, vertical and diagonal direction.
Note that the field of view can have different shapes, e.g. circular or rectangular.</li>
<li>Alternatively, one may specify a solid angle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reference point for the mentioned angles is the center of the <a href="entrance_and_exit_pupil.html" title="the apparent apertures of an optical system, seen from the object or image side">entrance pupil</a>.</p>
<p>The term <em>field of view</em> is not only used for that field itself, but also for its magnitude.
In some cases, for example for <a href="telecentric_lenses.html" title="lenses or objectives having the entrance or exit pupil at infinity">telecentric lenses</a>, it is used for the viewed area on the object plane.</p>
<p>In some cases, the term <em>angle of acceptance</em> is used instead of <em>field of view</em> &ndash; particularly for non-imaging optical instruments.</p>
<p>The field of view of an optical imaging instrument is often limited by an intentionally created field stop.
This is an <a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">optical aperture</a>, e.g. in the form of a <a href="diaphragms.html" title="circular (or approximately circular) openings through which light can travel">diaphragm</a>, which is placed in an <a href="image_planes.html" title="planes which are conjugate to an object plane, so that objects are imaged there">image plane</a> or close to such a plane, such that the edges of the field of view are sharply defined.
However, in some cases one obtains <a href="vignetting.html" title="a reduction of image brightness in peripheral regions">vignetting</a> effects, i.e., a gradual decrease of image brightness towards the edges of the field of view.
This happens when the field of view is limited by an aperture which is not in an image plane.
An example for that situation can be found in the article on <a href="field_lenses.html" title="lenses in imaging instruments which affect the field of view">field lenses</a>, where we vignetting in an optical telescope is explained.
In cases with vignetting, one may define different values for the field of view &ndash; for example, the field without any vignetting, the field up to the point of half-vignetting or (is the very maximum) up to the point where the intensity vanishes.</p>
<p>The field of view of the human eye is also not precisely defined.
Maximum image resolution is only achieved in the central area, and the peripheral regions exhibit a substantially lower image quality.
This is largely compensated by rapid eye movements for covering a wider angular range and accurately viewing objects of particular interest.</p>
<aside class="callout red">One may need to limit the field of view to achieve a certain image quality!</aside>
<p>As mentioned above, the field of view of an instrument is often intentionally limited.
This is often not motivated by its application, but rather because the image quality would be too much degraded by <a href="optical_aberrations.html" title="degradations of optical images caused in imaging instruments">optical aberrations</a> when permitting a larger field of view.
Advanced optical designs, e.g. based on <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric</a> lenses or more refined combinations of lenses, can offer a wider field of view with good image quality.
However, they are not always employed, e.g. for reasons of higher cost, size or weight of the instruments.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Field of View of Photo Cameras</h2>
<div>
<p>The field of view of a <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photo camera</a> depends on both the used <a href="photographic_objectives.html" title="objective lenses used for photography">photographic objective</a> and the size of the photographic film or the <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensor</a>.
This is explained in Figure&nbsp;1, which shows the optical configuration is a greatly simplified way: the objective is represented by a single lens, although it is usually a system containing multiple lenses.
One can simply consider <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">rays</a> coming from object points and going through the center of the lens, where no ray deflection occurs.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/field_of_view.png" alt="angular field of view">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
The field of view depends on the sensor size and the focal length of the used lens.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For small angles, the full-angle field of view in radians is approximately the sensor diameter divided by the focal length; for obtaining a value in degrees, one has to multiply that with <span class="eqn_il">180&deg;&thinsp;/&thinsp;<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>.
For wide angle cameras, one has to use a more accurate formula:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/fov.gif" width="145" height="41" alt="field of view"></div>
<p>where <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i></span> is the sensor width.</p>

<p>The field of view gets particularly small when using a tele-objective, while <em>wide field objectives</em> are by definition made for a large field of view.
Extreme versions are called <em>fish-eye objectives</em>; they produce substantial image distortions, which are hardly avoidable in that regime.</p>
<p>Standard photographic objectives are made such that their field of view is similar to that of the human eye &ndash; with a full horizontal angle around 50&deg;, when considering the range with reasonable sharp imaging.</p>
<p>When changing the zoom setting of an objective, the field of view will change, of course.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Field of View of Telescopes</h2>
<div>
<p>Telescopes provide some <a href="magnification.html" title="the enlargements of images">magnification</a> for viewing distant objects.
The higher the magnification, the smaller is typically the field of view.
However, there are optical designs which provide a larger field of view for given magnification.
For example, a simple Keplerian telescope has a small field of view, which can be expanded by inserting an additional <a href="field_lenses.html" title="lenses in imaging instruments which affect the field of view">field lens</a>.</p>
<p>A large field of view is particularly relevant, for example, for astronomical telescopes which are used in stellar surveys.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Field of View with Viewing Aids and Eye Protection</h2>
<div>
<p>The field of view of the eye may be restricted by various kinds of devices, for example by correction glasses of small size or by <a href="magnifying_glasses.html" title="optical lenses held above objects for viewing them with some moderate magnification">magnifying glasses</a>.
In some cases, the peripheral view is completely blocked, e.g. with some <a href="eye_protection.html" title="the protection of eyes against laser hazards">laser goggles</a>; that can introduce additional hazards, e.g. of bumping into items which could not be seen.</p>
