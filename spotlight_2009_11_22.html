<div class="posting_details">
<p>Posted on 2009-11-22 as a part of the <a href="spotlight.html">Photonics Spotlight (available as e-mail newsletter!)</a>
<p>Permanent link: <a href="spotlight_2009_11_22.html" class="url">https://www.rp-photonics.com/spotlight_2009_11_22.html</a></p>
<p>Author: <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/paschotta.html" rel="author">Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta</a>, <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/">RP Photonics Consulting GmbH</a></p>
<p>Abstract: The article shows that focusing a laser beam does not mean creating a demagnified image of the original beam profile. This has implications in the context of beam quality and beam shaping.</p>
</div>
<figure class="right" style="width:130px;">
<img src="img/paschotta5.jpg" alt="Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta">
</figure>
<p>Imagine that you have a <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated</a> <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> which has a clean <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian</a> intensity profile.
Now you use a lens to focus that beam down to a small spot.
Will you obtain a nice Gaussian beam shape also in the focus?</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/focused_beam.png" alt="focused laser beam">
</figure>
<p>I suppose that many people would indeed expect that, as they believe that the focus is basically just a demagnified copy of the original large beam.
Therefore, they believe that it is sufficient to inspect the profile where it is large &ndash; which is often much easier to do than inspecting the beam around focus.
(Particularly for <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>, it is inconvenient to inspect the focus, as the intensities are very high, and it is not always trivial to attenuate a beam while preserving its profile.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the described expectation is utterly wrong.
Without inspecting the focus itself (or knowing the details of your beam source), you don't really know your beam.
The beam profile may contain phase distortions which you cannot see by looking only at intensity profiles.
While the beam is collimated, such phase distortions may have only negligible effects.
Once you get to the focus, however, they become important.
In particular, you may get a non-Gaussian beam shape there, and the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> may be significantly larger than you expect based on a calculation for <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Wavefront Sensors Can Do More</h2>
<div>
<p>Well, there is actually a way of fully characterizing a beam without looking at the focus.
You have to measure not only the intensity profile, but also the phase profile.
This can be done with some kind of wavefront sensor (for example, a <a href="shack_hartmann_wavefront_sensors.html" title="wavefront sensors which are based on a microlens array">Shack&ndash;Hartmann wavefront sensor</a>).
If you do this for one arbitrary position (just where it is convenient), you can calculate the beam profile at any other position.
Unfortunately, wavefront sensors also have their limitations (for example, concerning spatial resolution) and are expensive.</p>
<p>The phase profiles of monochromatic beams can also be recorded with <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometry</a> &ndash; which is also not a totally easy thing to do.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Focusing is Not Imaging</h2>
<div>
<p>I also emphasize that what you do if you focus a collimated beam is <em>not</em> imaging.
In other words, the focus is <em>not</em> a demagnified image of your original beam profile.
The intensity at each point in the focus depends not only on the intensity at one point in the large beam, but rather on the whole intensity and phase profile.</p>
<p>In case that it still needs more to convince you: use some <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescope</a> to reduce the beam radius of the collimated beam before it hits the focusing lens.
You will find that the focused spot will get <em>larger</em> rather than smaller.</p>

<h2>The Transparent Laser</h2>
<p>The dream of each laser developer, and not only of each laser scientist: have a <b>transparent laser</b>, where you can <b>look into any components</b> and see e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>optical intensities</li>
<li>excitation densities of laser-active ions</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and this at any location and time, with arbitrary resolution!</p>
<p>If you had this, finally you could</p>
<ul>
<li>fully understand what goes on in your laser,</li>
<li>quickly identify and fix any problems, and</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">make faster progress <br> while saving a lot of money.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely marvelous, but only a dream?!?</p>
<p>Good news: such transparent lasers can be made!
