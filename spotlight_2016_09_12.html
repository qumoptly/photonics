<p>Today I want to show you an interesting situation in <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a> which leads to an apparent paradox.
By reading this, you will strengthen your understanding of the relation between <a href="wave_optics.html" title="the description of optical phenomena based on wave models">wave optics</a> and <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">ray optics</a>.
You will also see that some claims which are relatively common in the literature are actually quite wrong.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Zig-zag Path in a Multimode Fiber</h2>
<div>
<p>When explaining the basic operation principle of an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>, it is quite common to consider light rays.
Some rays may propagate just along the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, while others, having been launched into the fiber with a substantial angle against the fiber axis, follow a zig-zag path:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_acceptance_angle.png" alt="zig-zag path in a multimode fiber">
</figure>
<p>The maximum angle of incidence of such a light ray is limited by the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> of the fiber, which is related to the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> difference between <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> and <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">cladding</a>.</p>
<p>Now an interesting question is how the phase shift experienced by such a zig-zag ray is compared with that of a ray going straight through.
It is perfectly reasonable to believe that the zig-zag ray gets a larger phase delay since it travels a longer path in the fiber.
That then leads many people to the belief that higher-order guided modes, having larger transverse components of the <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector (just as the tilted ray), also experience larger phase shifts.
Curiously, the opposite is true!
When using some mode solver (as is e.g. contained in our <a href="fiberpower.html">RP Fiber Power</a> software), you can easily verify that the phase constants (<span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&beta;</span></span> values) and <a href="effective_refractive_index.html" title="a number quantifying the phase delay per unit length in a waveguide, relative to the phase delay in vacuum">effective refractive indexs</a> of the higher-modes are indeed <em>smaller</em> than the corresponding quantities for the fundamental mode.</p>
<p>In order to understand that, let us consider waves (rather than rays) propagating in the fiber.
For simplicity, we can assume that the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> is constant within the fiber core.
The light propagating there can then be considered as a superposition of <a href="plane_waves.html" title="waves with plane wavefronts">plane waves</a>, all having the same <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector, only with different orientations.
For each of those plane waves, the <span class="eqn_il"><i>z</i></span> component of the wave vector (<span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i><sub><i>z</i></sub></span>) is somewhat smaller than the magnitude of the wave vector, because part of that is &ldquo;consumed&rdquo; for the transverse components.
And <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i><sub><i>z</i></sub></span> exactly tells you how much phase change you obtain in <span class="eqn_il"><i>z</i></span> direction per unit distance!
This shows that the phase shift is indeed reduced if you have larger transverse components of the wave vector, which inevitably lead to smaller longitudinal components.</p>
<p>So what we have found somehow looks like a paradox: we do have one explanation for the increased phase shift of the ray and another explanation for the decreased phase shift of a wave, but obviously the result should not depend on how we analyze the situation, as long as we are doing it correctly!
In order to resolve that issue, we have to carefully look at what situation we really consider:</p>
<p>If you really excite some higher-order mode of a fiber, you will get the reduced phase shift compared with that of the fundamental mode &ndash; just as the mode solver would tell you.
You could also verify that with numerical beam propagation.</p>
<p>If however you inject something like a light beam into the fiber, which is supposed to somehow resemble a ray, things are bit more difficult: a real light beam, other than a mathematical ray, will exhibit <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a>, and the details of its reflection at an interface (involving <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effects) are also different.
So we should look only at a limited lengths of fiber, well below the <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> of the injected beam, so that we can still identify the involving pattern with an approximate ray.</p>
<p>I have investigated an example case for a light beam with numerical beam propagation, using our software <a href="fiberpower.html">RP Fiber Power</a>.
I have assumed a multimode fiber with the core radius of 30&nbsp;&mu;m.
The initial beam has a Gaussian profile with 15&nbsp;&mu;m <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> and is tilted in the <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> direction by 60&nbsp;mrad.
With these settings, the <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">geometrical</a> ray would reach the outer part of the cladding after 0.5&nbsp;mm of fiber, and would have been reflected back to the fiber axis after 1&nbsp;mm total.
The figure below shows the optical intensity profile in the x&ndash;z plane.
One can roughly see how the &ldquo;beam&rdquo; first goes upwards and is then reflected at the core&ndash;cladding interface.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/beam_in_fiber.png" alt="light beam in a fiber">
</figure>
<p>Obtaining the phase delay of the beam is not totally trivial.
What we immediately get with numerical beam propagation is the output beam profile, i.e., the complex amplitudes in the output plane, but from these we cannot directly see how many optical cycles have been performed.
In order to find out that, one can numerically follow the complex amplitudes along the mathematical ray, so that one can count these cycles.
I did this (requiring just a few lines of <a href="software_script_language.html">script code</a>) and found that the total phase delay was indeed slightly larger than that for a ray along the fiber axis, in good agreement with the ray picture.</p>
<p>So we see that in fact we do not have a contradiction between the ray picture and the wave picture.
After all, numerical beam propagation is also based on waves rather than on geometrical rays.
The point is just that such a light beam, roughly resembling a ray, cannot be identified with a higher-order guided mode.
In reality, it is a complex superposition of many such modes.
What total phase change results for such a superposition is not so obvious: you cannot simply assume that the total phase change is something like an average phase change of the involved modes.
In conclusion, one should be very careful not to assume a too close relation between geometrical rays and guided modes.</p>
