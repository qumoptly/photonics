<p>Abstract: The article explains why threshold values are often given for the onset of nonlinear effects, how Raman and Brillouin scattering lead to nonlinear power losses, and how nonlinear effects can be reduced in fiber amplifiers.</p>
</div>
<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>, <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a>, <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a>, <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>, <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">laser threshold</a></p>

<p>Comparing with <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>, <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> exhibit a much higher tendency for unwanted nonlinear effects, because they typically use a much longer solid medium, and this with a rather small <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a>.
Frequently, one calculates a &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; for the onset of such effects, even though they normally do not exhibit a threshold which is as well-defined as a <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">laser threshold</a>.
It is instructive to think a little more on this.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Unwanted Power Extraction by Stimulated Raman Scattering</h2>
<div>
<p>Stimulated <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a> (SRS) in a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a> generates some amount of <a href="raman_gain.html" title="optical gain arising from stimulated Raman scattering">Raman gain</a> in the region of somewhat longer wavelengths.
For simplicity, let us assume that these wavelengths are clearly separated from the spectral region of the amplified signal light (which is sometimes not the case, for example in <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compression</a> experiments).
Although there is no input signal in that longer-wavelength region with nonlinear gain, some significant power can be extracted here.
In a semiclassical model, this can be explained as follows: even with no classical input signal, there are vacuum fluctuations (<a href="vacuum_noise.html" title="quantum noise of the vacuum state, or quantum noise introduced into an optical system via a vacuum input">vacuum noise</a>) entering the device, which can be amplified to macroscopic power levels.
This can occur in two directions: co-propagating with the signal and counter-propagating.
If the Raman gain gets too high (for example, well above 40&thinsp;dB), much of the original signal power may be transferred into this longer-wavelength region, and the amplifier performance is degraded severely.</p>
<p>Such unwanted power extraction does not really set in at a well-defined threshold power.
However, the extracted power rises exponentially.
Let us assume that at some signal power level we get only 1&#37; of the power removed by SRS, and that the SRS gain is 40&thinsp;dB here.
If we now increase the signal power level by only 10&#37;, the extracted power rises by 4&thinsp;dB, i.e., to &asymp;2.3&#37; of the signal power.
So we have something one may call a &ldquo;soft threshold&rdquo; in terms of the allowable signal power.
For amplification of <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a>, what counts is of course the <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Similar Effects from Stimulated Brillouin Scattering</h2>
<div>
<p>With stimulated <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a>, similar effects can occur, but with some important differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The gain occurs only in backward direction.
(Only in relatively exotic situations, some small level of forward Brillouin scattering can be observed.)</li>
<li>The <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> is much smaller &ndash; of the order of 50&thinsp;MHz, to be compared with hundreds of GHz for Raman scattering.
Therefore, significant power extraction can occur only once the Brillouin gain gets to the order of 90&nbsp;dB.</li>
<li>If the optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of the signal exceeds the Brillouin gain bandwidth, the Brillouin gain spectrum is &ldquo;smeared&rdquo; out, so that the peak gain is reduced and the effective Brillouin threshold becomes higher accordingly.
For that reason, stimulated Raman scattering is often the dominating problem, despite the smaller intrinsic nonlinear gain.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fighting Against Nonlinearities</h2>
<div>
<p>Reducing nonlinear effects is often a central issue in the design of active fiber devices, in particular of fiber amplifiers for short pulse amplification.
A good thing is to increase the <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> of the fiber, but there are limits to that, assuming that you need transverse single-mode performance for high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
Making devices shorter by using higher <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentrations</a> may also be useful, but there are limits to the acceptable doping concentration and also to the heat load per unit length.
On the materials side, there is not much one can do: <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> already have a fairly low nonlinearity, and one may only avoid the excessive use of certain dopants in the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>.
Sometimes, one needs to increase the signal <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> in order to avoid problems with Brillouin scattering.
Another approach is to broaden the Brillouin gain spectrum via longitudinal or transverse variations of the Brillouin frequency shift.
That may be worth a Spotlight article at some later time.</p>

<ul>
<li>understand <em>quantitatively</em> what is going on</li>
