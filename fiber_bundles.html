</header>
<p>For some applications, some number of optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> is bundled together, forming a <em>fiber bundle</em> or <em>fiber-optic bundle</em>.
In most cases, one uses <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode</a> <a href="large_core_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large fiber core">large-core</a> <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> or <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic fibers</a>.
Sometimes, only a small number of fibers is joined &ndash; for example, seven fibers, where six of them are arranged around one central one &ndash;, while in other cases one uses a very large number of fibers.</p>
<p>The fibers are often put together such that they form a hexagonal pattern (see Figure&nbsp;1).
Alternatively, they may be assembled randomly, i.e., with an irregular pattern.
The overall shape may be hexagonal, approximately circular or rectangular, but other forms (e.g. rings) are possible as well.
One can bundle bare glass or plastic fibers, or sometimes fibers which have some thin polymer coating (e.g. of polyimide), which does not substantially increase the fiber diameter and may serve to reduce mechanical stress.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_bundle.png" alt="fiber bundle">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A fiber bundle with a hexagonal arrangement of the fibers for maximum packaging density. One originally obtains the arrangement shown on the left side, but by fusing the heated fibers one can obtain a structure as shown on the right side.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The volume between the fibers may be filled with some glue, for example, or just remain empty.
In some cases, one presses the fibers together while heating them, so that they become soft and get fused together; that is usually done only with the end portions, so that the other parts of the bundle remain flexible.
The input coupling losses (see below) can be reduced that way, because dead space is eliminated.</p>
<p>For imaging applications (see below), and sometimes requires bundles consisting of many very small fibers.
They are often not made directly by bundling a large number of such fibers.
An alternative fabrication method starts with a process similar to the fabrication of a <a href="fiber_optic_plates.html" title="transparent plates containing many optical fibers">fiber-optic plate</a>, where one bundles fibers, fuses them to obtain another fiber preform, and draws that into a multi-fiber, containing many fiber cores.
That process can be repeated to obtain a further increased number of fibers, and one can then assemble many such multi-multi-fibers side by side.
It is possible to later on separate all the contained fibers again with an etching process, if the preform contains a suitable type of glass between the fibers which can be etched away.
Such bundles are called <em>leached imaging bundles</em>.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to produce <em>wound fiber bundles</em>, which consist of some number of multi-fibers; each of those is drawn from a preform assembled from multiple fibers.
In such a wound bundle, the multi-fibers can move against each other, except at the fused ends, but the fibers within each multi-fiber remain fixed to each other.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Flexible Fiber Bundle Cables</h2>
<div>
<p>One usually applies a polymeric coating and further protection layers around the whole bundle, e.g. a sleeve or flexible tube, often made of stainless steel.
If only such an enclosure is used without gluing or fusing the fibers together, a fiber bundle can be highly flexible.
It can then be bent and twisted, and it can be used as a flexible light pipe, similar to an electrical cable, even if its thickness is substantial.
The thinner the used fibers are, the better can be the flexibility of the bundle.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Rods</h2>
<div>
<p>If the whole bundle is fused, one obtains a rigid <em>fiber rod</em>.
This can still be somewhat deformed, e.g. bent, twisted or tapered while being heated to a sufficiently high temperature.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Profile Conversion</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Fiber bundles may have different input and output shapes.</aside>
<p>The shapes of the input and output interface do not necessarily have to be identical.
For example, there are fiber bundles where the input fibers are arranged to a circle, while the output fibers form a rectangle, a narrow line or a cross.
Such round-to-line profile converters, for example, are used for spectrometers (see below).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Branched Bundles</h2>
<div>
<p>It is also possible to make fiber bundles which are split (branched) or merged.
For example, there are Y bundles with one input and two output bundles.
There are also multi-branch fiber bundles with more outputs, e.g. 1-to-7 fan-out bundles containing just seven fibers, or alternatively some larger number of fibers in each output cable.</p>
<p>Branched fiber bundles can be used, for example, as splitters for illuminating multiple spots with a single light source, or as combiners for multiple signals sent to a single instrument.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Ordered and Unordered Bundles</h2>
<div>
<p>Fiber bundles may be ordered or unordered.
In the former case, there is a one-to-one correspondence concerning the arrangement of input and output fibers; this is required for imaging applications, for example.
Ordered fiber bundles are also called <em>coherent</em>, although that has nothing to do with the usual meaning of <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> in optics.
Unordered (incoherent) bundles are made such that there is a pseudo-random relation between input and output fibers.
That can be useful for illumination purposes and for certain sensors, for example.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Connectorization</h2>
<div>
<p>In some cases, fiber bundles are equipped with <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a> (e.g. of FC type) to obtain flexible <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber cables</a> which can easily be connected to instruments.
That can usually be done only with a limited number of fibers, for example four or seven.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Customized Solutions</h2>
<div>
<p>Some suppliers offer fiber bundles which can be customized in many ways, for example concerning the type, number and dimension of fibers, length, shapes and branching.</p>
<p>Although most fiber bundles are made either from <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> or <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic fibers</a>, there are custom solutions based on a wide range of <a href="specialty_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with special designs or materials">specialty fibers</a>, for example mid-infrared fibers.
One can also have mixed bundles containing different types of fibers.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Tapered Bundles</h2>
<div>
<p>It is possible to <a href="tapered_fibers.html" title="optical fibers which are over some length stretched out to a very small diameter">taper</a> not only single fibers, but also whole fiber bundles which are fused together.
See the article on <a href="fiber_optic_tapers.html" title="fiber-optic plates which are tapered for obtaining some image magnification">fiber-optic tapers</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Launching Light into Fiber Bundles</h2>
<div>
<p>Each fiber has a limited <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> according to its <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> contrast between <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> and <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">cladding</a>.
The resulting limitation of the angular range also applies to input and output of the whole fiber bundle.
Quite different values of numerical aperture can occur, mostly between 0.1 and 1.</p>
<p>In most cases, no attempt is made to launch light into specific fibers, or to concentrate it into the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber cores</a>.
Instead, one more or less uniformly illuminates the input face of a fiber bundle, e.g. with a <a href="halogen_lamps.html" title="incandescent lamps with a halogen filling, allowing for higher operation temperatures">halogen lamp</a>, with <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diodes</a> (LEDs) or a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>.
Some of the light hitting the input face will then be lost &ndash; in particular, the light which gets into the space between the fibers (where <a href="propagation_losses.html" title="losses of optical energy during propagation of light">propagation losses</a> are often very high), and also light getting into the <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">fiber claddings</a>, from where light can often get into the lossy space between the fibers.
For minimum losses, one uses <a href="large_core_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large fiber core">large-core fibers</a>, where the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> has an only slightly smaller diameter than the <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">fiber cladding</a>.
The useful (light-guiding) fraction of the input area may then exceed 50&#37;.</p>
<p><a href="fresnel_reflections.html" title="light reflections at optical interfaces">Fresnel reflections</a> at the end faces cause losses, which can be reduced with <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coatings</a>.
Note that imaging fiber bundles often have a high-index core glass, where the Fresnel reflections are much stronger than for ordinary fibers.
It can then be particularly important to use anti-reflection coatings.</p>
<p>Additional light losses can occur within the fibers; the latter effect, however, is often comparatively weak, since fiber bundles are usually not very long, and the other losses dominate.</p>
<p>When two fiber bundles are connected to each other, there are usually substantial additional light losses because the fiber positions cannot be matched at the interface.</p>
<p>For coupling a high <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> from some kind of lamp (e.g. a <a href="halogen_lamps.html" title="incandescent lamps with a halogen filling, allowing for higher operation temperatures">halogen lamp</a>) into a fiber bundle, one can use a <a href="condensers.html" title="lenses or lens systems for conditioning light from an illumination source">condenser</a> where the numerical aperture of the bundle is matched and unwanted <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a> is eliminated with a <a href="cold_mirrors.html" title="mirrors which can reduce the heat load in an optical system by reflecting only visible radiation">cold mirror</a>, for example (which is particularly important for plastic fibers).
One may also use a <a href="field_lenses.html" title="lenses in imaging instruments which affect the field of view">field lens</a> for achieving uniform illumination.</p>
<p>There are fiber bundles which are specially optimized for transmitting light from <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power lasers</a>, sometimes with the ability to transport several kilowatts of <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
Some of them are made from copper-coated multimode fibers, where the copper metal layer helps to distribute heat.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Loss of Coherence and Polarization</h2>
<div>
<p>Generally, both the <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> and the <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a> of light are not preserved by a fiber bundle.
For example, the relative phase delay for propagation through two different fibers of a bundle is generally random and changes when the bundle is bent, for example.
However, fiber bundles are anyway mostly used with incoherent and unpolarized light.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Cross-talk</h2>
<div>
<p>For some applications, it is important to have a minimum amount of cross-talk between the fibers.
That is particularly the case for imaging applications.</p>
<p>When using ordinary <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index</a> <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a> with a not too small cladding layer, there should normally be very little cross-talk for light launched into the fiber cores.
However, this might change when the fibers are fused together.
Also, one might have light propagating between the fibers, if that region is not too lossy, and that light may emerge at quite different locations at the output.
Suppression of such light, which could propagate in an uncontrolled manner, one sometimes introduces absorber materials.
For more details, see the article on <a href="fiber_optic_plates.html" title="transparent plates containing many optical fibers">fiber-optic plates</a>.</p>
<p>There are also specialized bundles made from metal-coated fibers, which are made for certain applications in <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Broken Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>Particularly after some time of use, a fiber bundle may contain some broken fibers, which exhibit a much reduced light transmission.
That can be particularly detrimental for imaging applications, while some moderate additional lights loss may not matter much for an illumination purpose.</p>
<p>The specifications for fiber bundles may include some fraction of allowed broken (dark) fibers, resulting from the fabrication process.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of Fiber Bundles</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Illumination</h3>
<div>
<p>Mostly unordered (&ldquo;incoherent&rdquo;) fiber bundles are used for light transport in illumination systems.
It is also possible to branch a bundle for distributing light from a single light source to multiple places, for example.
Flexible bundles are convenient in some cases, while others are used in fixed configurations.
A high <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> can enhance the light transmission, but also leads to a wider angular range at the output.</p>
<p>It can be advantageous to keep a light source away from the illuminated setup, avoiding influences of generated heat, for example.
In other cases, the illuminated area contains strong electric fields, explosive substances or other things which should not come close to the light source.</p>
<p>Illumination may not only be done with visible light, but also with <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>, e.g. for UV curing of adhesives.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Light Collection and Shape Matching</h3>
<div>
<p>Connectorized fiber bundles can be used for transporting light e.g. to a <a href="spectrometers.html" title="devices for separating spectral components">spectrometer</a>.
Compared with a single fiber, one can transport more light.
Another interesting aspect is that one may collect light from a circular area while having the light output along a line, which fits well to the input <a href="optical_slits.html" title="narrow openings through which light can be transmitted">slit</a> of a <a href="monochromators.html" title="optical devices which transmit only light in an adjustable small range of optical wavelengths">monochromator</a>.
In that way, one can substantially improve the signal strength and the <a href="signal_to_noise_ratio.html" title="the ratio of signal power to noise power in a detector">signal-to-noise ratio</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Imaging</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">For flexible endoscopes, fiber bundles are essential.</aside>
<p>Ordered (&ldquo;coherent&rdquo;) fiber bundles can be used for imaging applications.
For example, they may transmit images in medical endoscopes.
While a single fiber could not transmit an image, a large fiber bundle can do that, because there is little coupling between the fibers; each fiber represents one pixel of an image.</p>
<p>There are imaging fiber bundles containing the order of 100,000 fibers of small diameter (possibly &lt;10&nbsp;&mu;m), resulting in a total diameter of a couple of millimeters.
One may produce images with a resolution of 50 lines per millimeter or even more, comparable to that of some <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensors</a>.
However, due to the limited number of fibers the resulting image quality is still much lower than that of a modern image sensor, which can have millions of pixels.</p>
<p>Of course, the observed objects need to be imaged to the input of the fiber bundle, using some kind of <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objective</a>.</p>
<p>In an endoscope, additional fibers can be used for illumination.
That can be done with an unordered fiber bundle around the ordered imaging bundle.</p>
<p>In some other cases, one exploits the mechanical flexibility of a fiber bundle for image inversion.
For example, there are <a href="night_vision_devices.html" title="instruments which allow viewing or imaging under conditions of very low light levels">night vision devices</a> where the image inversion by the <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objective</a> is compensated with a 180&deg; twisted fiber bundle between the <a href="image_intensifiers_and_image_converters.html" title="instruments which can intensify images acquired under faint light conditions, or convert images to other wavelengths">image intensifier</a> and the optical output.</p>
<p>A fiber bundle may also be used to transport light from a <a href="phosphors.html" title="substances which exhibit luminescence, used mostly for illumination and displays">phosphor</a> screen of an image intensifier to an <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensor</a>.
Compared with a traditional <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a>-based optical setup, the image quality is far worse, but the coupling efficiency may be higher, unless a lens system with particularly low <a href="f_number.html" title="a measure for the open aperture of a photographic objective">f-number</a> is used.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Sensors</h3>
<div>
<p>Various types of <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="optical sensors based on fiber devices">optical sensors</a> utilize fiber bundles.
For example, one may use a Y bundle for a reflection probe, where one branch provides illumination light and a second branch collects reflected light.
Using UV-transmitting fibers, one can for example illuminate a sample with <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> and collect induced <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> light.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Thermal Imaging</h3>
<div>
<p>Some fiber bundles made from infrared fibers are used for <a href="thermal_imaging.html" title="imaging based on thermal radiation">thermal imaging</a>, where the <a href="infrared_detectors.html" title="detectors for infrared light">infrared detector</a> is placed in a dewar at a very low temperature, and a fiber bundle is used to transport the infrared radiation to the detector.</p>
