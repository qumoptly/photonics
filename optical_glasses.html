<p>There is a wide range of glass <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">materials</a> which are optimized for optical applications.
Mostly, one uses inorganic glasses, on which this article concentrates.
The article on <a href="plastic_optics.html" title="optical elements made of organic polymer materials">plastic optics</a> covers <em>organic glasses</em>, which increasingly substitute inorganic glasses in some applications, mainly because they can be used in low-cost fabrication technologies.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Typically Used Inorganic Glass Materials</h2>
<div>
<p>Inorganic glasses are made by mixing certain compounds, melting them and letting the mass slowly (but not too slowly) solidify, so that an amorphous material is obtained.
For more details of glass fabrication, see below.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Fused Silica and Silicate Glasses</h3>
<div>
<p>Silica (amorphous silicon dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>) is widely used in <a href="optics.html" title="the science and technology dealing with the properties and the propagation of light">optics</a>, either as a pure substance (&rarr;&nbsp;<em>fused silica</em>, <em>fused quartz</em>) or more frequently as a mixture with other compounds (<em>silicate glasses</em>).</p>
<p>Fused silica, often of high chemical purity, has quite favorable properties like a wide transparency range from the <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> to the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> region (depending on the material purity), low optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>, a low coefficient of thermal expansion, high mechanical robustness and high chemical stability.
Due to its very high solidification temperature, it can be operated at very high temperatures, but it is also difficult to process.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The infrared transmission of silica depends on its purity, particularly on its water content.</aside>
<p>While the infrared transmission of highly purified fused silica can be very good, silicate glass often exhibits pronounced <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> peaks due to impurities, e.g. water absorption peaks.</p>
<p>Mixing with additional compounds leads to related materials such as borosilicates, aluminosilicates, germanosilicates etc., which are discussed in the following.
Usually, silica remains the main constituent.</p>
<p>Most optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> are based on silica and are therefore called <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>.
Typically, the <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">fiber cladding</a> material is pure silica, while the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> is made of germanosilicate or germanoaluminosilicate, for example.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Soda&ndash;lime Glasses</h3>
<div>
<p>By adding substances like sodium oxide or carbonate, potassium oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide and aluminum oxide to silica, one obtains <em>soda&ndash;lime glasses</em>.
These are much softer than silica and have lower softening temperatures, so that they can be processed at accordingly lower temperatures.
They are the most common commercial glasses, widely used for household windows, glass bottles and many other applications, but not much as high quality optical materials.
For example, the high thermal expansion coefficient would not be favorable for optics applications.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Borosilicate Glasses</h3>
<div>
<p>Boron trioxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) can be mixed with silica, forming <em>borosilicate glass</em> (often with some other additions like sodium oxide and aluminum oxide).
For example, the often used BK7 glass is a <a href="crown_glasses.html" title="optical glasses with low chromatic dispersion and tentatively a low refractive index">crown glass</a> (see below) of that type.</p>
<p>Borosilicate glasses are chemically quite resistant, if the boron content is not too high.
Compared with fused silica, they have a lower (although still relatively high) melting temperature, which makes them simpler and therefore cheaper to process.
Their thermal expansion coefficient is higher than for fused silica, but still relatively low, resulting in good thermal shock resistance; therefore, borosilicate glasses are also used for cookware.
Variants with higher thermal expansion coefficients are also available, matching the values of other important materials such as certain metals.
High-borate variants are used e.g. in <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> applications.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Germanate Glasses</h3>
<div>
<p>Germanate glasses are obtained by adding germanium oxide (GeO<sub>2</sub>) and sometimes other constituents to silica.
Their <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> transmission extends to longer wavelengths, roughly 3&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
<p>Germanosilicates and related glasses such as germanoaluminosilicates are often used for <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber cores</a> of passive or <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">active</a> fibers, since their <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>, which can be controlled via the germanium content, is somewhat higher than that of silica, providing guidance of light.
The transmission losses in the infrared are of the order of 0.2&nbsp;dB/m, and it is possible to transmit laser beams with more than 10&nbsp;W of <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> through germanate <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Phosphate Glasses</h3>
<div>
<p><a href="phosphate_glasses.html" title="certain glasses from which certain optical fibers and laser gain media can be made, for example">Phosphate glasses</a> are based on phosphorus pentoxide (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) with some added chemical components.
They have a very low glass transition temperature (typically below 400&thinsp;&deg;C).
Their spectral range with high optical transmission is about 0.4&nbsp;&mu;m to 2&nbsp;&mu;m &ndash; somewhat narrower than for silica glasses.
They exhibit a much lower <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage</a> threshold and a lower thermal conductivity than silicate glasses.</p>
<p>The opto-thermal coefficient <span class="eqn_il">dn&thinsp;/&thinsp;dT</span> of phosphate glasses is negative, in contrast to many other materials.
The <a href="nonlinear_index.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the Kerr nonlinearity of a medium">nonlinear index</a> is very low &ndash; nearly 3 times lower than for silica glasses.</p>
<p>Mixtures of phosphate and fluoride glass are called <em>fluorophosphate glasses</em>.
Similarly, there are phosphosilicate glasses.</p>
<p><a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">Rare-earth-doped</a> phosphate glasses are used as laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain media</a> &ndash; both in <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> and in the form of optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> for <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">lasers</a>.
One of their primary advantages is their very high solubility for rare earth ions (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped gain media</a>) such as erbium (Er<sup>3+</sup>), ytterbium (Yb<sup>3+</sup>) and neodymium (Nd<sup>3+</sup>).
This means that high concentrations of laser-active rare earth ions can be incorporated into phosphate glasses without detrimental effects such as clustering, which could degrade the performance via <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> effects.</p>
<p>See also the article on <a href="phosphate_glasses.html" title="certain glasses from which certain optical fibers and laser gain media can be made, for example">phosphate glasses</a> with more details particularly on their use as laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain media</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Fluoride Glasses</h3>
<div>
<p>Fluoride glasses belong to the non-oxide glasses, made from compounds of fluorine with zirconium, for example (<em>fluorozirconate glass</em>), aluminum (<em>fluoroaluminate glasses</em>), or with indium (<em>fluoroindate fibers</em>).
They can also contain various other heavy metals like lead.</p>
<p>Fluoride glasses are difficult to produce with high optical quality because of their tendency for crystallization during the glass transition.
They are mechanically quite weak (fragile) and not resistant to moisture, for example.</p>
<p>Fluoride and fluorophosphate glasses can be used as high-index low-dispersion glasses, e.g. for the construction of <a href="achromatic_optics.html" title="optical devices or setups with minimized chromatic aberrations">achromatic optics</a>.</p>
<p>A special property of heavy-metal fluoride glasses is their good transmission in the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region.
Therefore, they are mostly used for <a href="infrared_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems which are suitable for infrared light">infrared optics</a>.</p>
<p>Among the fluorozirconate glasses for fibers, ZBLAN (ZrF<sub>4</sub>-BaF<sub>2</sub>-LaF<sub>3</sub>-AlF<sub>3</sub>-NaF) is the most common.
Such fibers can be doped with a number of <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare earth ions</a> for application in <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a>.
There are fluoride-based <a href="upconversion_lasers.html" title="lasers relying on upconversion processes">upconversion lasers</a> in the form <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> or <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>.</p>
<p>For more details, see the article on <a href="fluoride_glasses.html" title="glasses made from compounds of fluorine e.g. with zirconium, aluminum or indium">fluoride glasses</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Chalcogenide Glasses</h3>
<div>
<p>Chalcogenides are chemical compounds containing chalcogens like oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium.
However, the term <em>chalcogenide glasses</em> is mostly used for non-oxide glasses, i.e., for sulfides, selenides or tellurides e.g. of arsenic (As) or germanium (Ge).
They have substantially lower vibration frequencies (thus also lower phonon energies) than silica due to the higher mass of chalcogenide ions (comparing with oxygen ions).
Consequently, their infrared absorption starts at longer wavelengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sulphide glasses like arsenic trisulfide (As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>) are suitable e.g. for wavelengths of 1 to 6&nbsp;&mu;m, but can exhibit strong absorption peaks within that wavelength range, e.g. at &asymp;4&nbsp;&mu;m (see below).</li>
<li>Selenide glass (As<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>) can be used up to &asymp;9&nbsp;&mu;m.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="propagation_losses.html" title="losses of optical energy during propagation of light">propagation losses</a> are often high due to impurities &ndash; much higher e.g. than those of fluoride glasses (see above).</p>
<p>Chalcogenide glasses have a low <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a> and are thus not suitable for guiding shorter-wavelength light.
(For that reason, such glasses also look colored, e.g. orange.)
<a href="mid_infrared_fibers.html" title="optical fibers for use with mid-infrared light">Mid-infrared fibers</a> based on chalcogenide glass are sometimes labeled as CIR = chalcogenide-based infrared fibers.
They are chemically fairly stable, e.g. insensitive to moisture, in contrast to some other mid-IR materials.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Filter and Attenuator Glasses</h3>
<div>
<p>Although high optical transmission is often very desirable for optical glasses, one sometimes exploits absorption for <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam">optical attenuators</a> and <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filters</a>, e.g. in form of colored filter glasses.
One may use the natural short-wavelength absorption above the bandgap wavelength, or the infrared absorption related to phonon generation.
Additional absorption can be obtained by doping glasses with certain absorbing substances like rare earth metals or metals like ion, copper and cadmium.</p>
<p><a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">Saturable absorbers</a> can also be realized with doped glasses, e.g. with certain transition metal ions like Cr<sup>4+</sup> or <a href="quantum_dots.html" title="microscopic structures confining charge carriers in three dimensions">quantum dots</a> as absorbers.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Poisonous Substances</h3>
<div>
<p>Some glass types used in <a href="optics.html" title="the science and technology dealing with the properties and the propagation of light">optics</a> and <a href="photonics.html" title="the science and technology of light">photonics</a> contain poisonous substances like arsenic, lead and cadmium.
While lead is often added for improving various optical properties, dopants like cadmium are used for optical filtering.
Although that hardly creates hazards during use, since those substances are tightly bound in the glass, there are serious attempts to ban their use wherever possible, since it is hard to ensure that those materials are properly handled after use so that they cannot get into the environment.
For many classical arsenic and lead-containing glasses, environmentally friendly arsenic- and lead-free alternatives have been developed, typically with &ldquo;N-&rdquo; added to their names.
For example, traditional BK7 glass is more and more replaced with N-BK7.</p>
<p>The RoHS directive of the European Union contributes much to that development.
However, it gives temporally limited exceptions for some specific applications of optical and colored filter glasses containing cadmium and lead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Crown and Flint Glasses</h2>
<div>
<p>Glasses can be broadly categorized according to their <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>.
Here, the chromatic dispersion is often quantified with a single figure, called the <a href="abbe_number.html" title="a measure for the chromatic dispersion of a transparent material">Abbe number</a> <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&nu;</span></span>, which is calculated from the refractive index at three different test wavelengths.</p>
<ul>
<li>Glasses with an Abbe number of larger than 55, indicating low chromatic dispersion, are called <a href="crown_glasses.html" title="optical glasses with low chromatic dispersion and tentatively a low refractive index"><em>crown glasses</em></a>.
They tentatively have a low refractive index.</li>
<li>Glasses with Abbe numbers below 50 are called <a href="flint_glasses.html" title="optical glasses with strong chromatic dispersion (low Abbe number) and tentatively a high refractive index"><em>flint glasses</em></a>, which typically have relatively high refractive index values.</li>
<li>There are some glasses with intermediate values of the Abbe number, forming a category without a special name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some authors use somewhat different boundaries between crown and flint glasses, for example using no region in between them, and sometimes using different limits for the Abbe number in regions with high or low refractive index.</p>
<p>The categorization into crown and flint glasses does not directly say anything on the chemical composition, but the high-dispersion flint glasses are tentatively more based on heavy constituents; they often contain lead, although lead-free alternatives are more and more offered.
Note that typical crown glasses like BK7 can also contain heavy metals like lead.</p>
<p>A good overview over different glass types can be obtained with an <span class="eqn_il"><i>n&minus;<span class="greek">&nu;</span></i></span> diagram (Abbe diagram), where each glass is represented by a point, where the coordinates are the Abbe number <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&nu;</span></span> and the refractive index <span class="eqn_il"><i>n</i></span>:</p>

<p>One can see that high-index glasses tend to have strong dispersion, although the correlation is of limited strength.
For comparison, <a href="plastic_optics.html" title="optical elements made of organic polymer materials">plastic optics</a> (organic glasses) tend to have low refractive indices but still relatively high dispersion.</p>
<p>The index of refraction and Abbe number are often combined to a numerical <em>glass code</em>, used e.g. by glass manufacturers in product catalogues.
Typically, one takes the first three digits of the refractive index value at some reference wavelength after the dot (with proper rounding) and combines that with the first three valid digits of the Abbe number.
For example, BK7 glass with the refractive index 1.5168 (at 587.6&nbsp;nm) and the Abbe number 64.17 gets the code 517642.
There are also extended codes, including information on the glass density after a dot.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Names of Glass Types</h2>
<div>
<p>Beyond the division into crown and flint glasses, there are names for certain glass types, which have been created by early German glassmakers like Friedrich Otto Schott.
For example, SF is the abbreviation for Schwerflint, meaning a heavy flint glass.

<h2 class="togglediv">Essential Properties of Optical Glasses</h2>
<div>
<p>The following optical properties are relevant for many applications of optical glasses:</p>
<ul>
<li>High transparency in the relevant wavelength range is usually a crucial requirement.
The transparency range is often limited by the bandgap energy on the short-wavelength side and by absorption involving phonons on the long-wavelength side.
In addition, there can be absorption caused by certain impurities; such <em>extrinsic</em> absorption losses can be minimized by using very pure materials.</li>
<li>Optical glasses should have a high degree of homogeneity, containing only a minimum amount of bubbles, striae and the like.
When different glass compounds are used, they should be thoroughly mixed to obtain a homogeneous chemical composition.
Some content of bubbles is hard to avoid in some special glasses, but may be tolerable e.g. even in <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> applications when they are not placed in an <a href="image_planes.html" title="planes which are conjugate to an object plane, so that objects are imaged there">image plane</a>.
A minimum amount of stress-induced birefringence is also wanted, and can be achieved by slow cooling during the solidification.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout red">The refractive index has a substantial dependence on the applied annealing rate!</aside>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> is important for <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> applications, for example.
A high refractive index is often useful, e.g. because <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a> can then be made with weaker surface curvature.
Note that the refractive index depends not only on the glass material, but also on the annealing rate applied during glass fabrication: rapid annealing can lead to a substantial drop of refractive index.
Therefore, precision glasses need to be fabricated with a well defined annealing rate.
This issue also needs to be carefully observed in the context of precision molding processes, where the cooling is typically quite rapid.</li>
<li>The wavelength dependence of the refractive index determines the <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>.
Although it is often desirable to minimize chromatic dispersion, the availability of high-dispersion glasses (flint glasses) is essential exactly for reaching that goal; for more details, see the article on <a href="achromatic_optics.html" title="optical devices or setups with minimized chromatic aberrations">achromatic optics</a>.</li>
<li>A high temperature coefficient of the refractive index can be disturbing in some applications.
That quantity varies substantially between different glasses.
Also, a high coefficient of thermal expansion can be detrimental for the optical performance, apart from causing internal strain which may lead to fracture through thermal shock.
Thermal expansion can also be relevant concerning <a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">dielectric coatings</a>, which may not stick well if there is a too large mismatch of expansion coefficients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, some other properties can be important:</p>
<ul>
<li>For applications involving high optical <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">intensities</a>, the <a href="nonlinear_index.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the Kerr nonlinearity of a medium">nonlinear index</a> of a glass can be relevant.
A high <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage</a> threshold is also important for applications with high optical intensities, e.g. from <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>.</li>
<li>Although a high homogeneity of refractive index is needed for most applications, special glasses with variable index are required for optical elements like <a href="gradient_index_lenses.html" title="lenses which utilize a radial variation of refractive index">gradient-index lenses</a>.
For example, for such purposes some glasses can be modified with ion exchange processes.</li>
<li>A low density is advantageous for making lightweight optics.</li>
<li>A high hardness (e.g. a Knoop Hardness greater than 600) makes an optical glass robust, but also more difficult to cut and polish.
Therefore, optical elements made from particularly hard glasses are tentatively more expensive.
Polishing of glass surfaces works best in a certain range of hardness values.</li>
<li>Other mechanical properties of interest are the elasticity and the abrasion resistance.</li>
<li>A high melting point allows for operation at high temperatures, but also makes the glass fabrication more difficult.</li>
<li>A high optical quality is easier to achieve for materials which have an appropriately broad temperature range for solidification and a low tendency for crystallization.</li>
<li>Most glasses are chemically relatively resistant, but there are exceptions.
For example, fluoride glasses are often sensitive to moisture.</li>
<li>For certain applications, for example in space technology or near nuclear reactors, the radiation resistance of optical glasses can be important.
Special radiation-resistant glasses are available.</li>
<li>There are photosensitive glasses for producing <a href="volume_bragg_gratings.html" title="Bragg gratings written into some bulk material">volume Bragg gratings</a>.</li>
<li>Glasses can be used as <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain media</a>, when they are doped with laser-active ions, e.g. <a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth ions</a>.</li>
<li>Some glasses are suitable for drawing glass preforms into glass <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>.</li>
<li><a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolators</a> require some special glasses with a high Verdet constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the same type of glass can have significantly different properties e.g. concerning absorption losses caused by impurities, depending on the material quality.
For example, fused silica with very low OH content is available which has a substantially improved transparency in the infrared spectral range.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Even perfect quality glass could fundamentally not offer zero propagation losses!</aside>
<p>Even for extremely high purity and homogeneity, an optical glass exhibits some level of propagation losses due to <a href="rayleigh_scattering.html" title="scattering of light at scattering centers which are much smaller than the wavelength">Rayleigh scattering</a>.
This is because glasses are amorphous materials, exhibiting some level of optical inhomogeneity on a microscopic level.
In some practical cases &ndash; for example for <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a> as used in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> in the 1.55-&mu;m region &ndash;, that theoretical limit for the propagation losses has been reached, with losses of only &approx;0.2&nbsp;dB/km, which is orders of magnitude lower than in ordinary window glasses, for example.
For reaching even lower losses, one would have to use longer optical wavelengths; note that the strength of Rayleigh scattering scales with the inverse fourth power of the wavelength.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Glass Fabrication; Supply Forms</h2>
<div>
<p>For producing high-quality optical glasses with good homogeneity, special precautions have to be taken.
This begins with using rather pure raw materials and equipment which is carefully designed to avoid contaminations with unwanted substances.
Typically, one fabricates <em>block glass</em> by filling some amount of glass melt into a block form, then leaving it for some time in molten form for settling down, and slowly cooling it up to solidification with a carefully controlled speed.
Slow cooling allows for annealing, i.e., the relief of internal mechanical stress.
A very slow and well defined annealing phase is important particularly for reaching a very low level of stress-induced <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a>, but also for reaching consistent <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> values.
Precision optical glass is often delivered as <em>fine annealed glass</em> with a reference annealing rate of e.g. 2&nbsp;K/h.</p>
<p>Other supply forms of raw optical glasses, from which optical components such as <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a> or <a href="prisms.html" title="transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prisms</a> can be made, are large strips and rods.
Some suppliers of optical glasses also offer processed forms like plates, cut prisms or pressed blanks.</p>
