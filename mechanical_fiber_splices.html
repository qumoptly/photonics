</header>
<p>In <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a>, for example in the context of <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, it is often necessary to connect the ends of optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> such that light from one fiber can get into the other fiber without losing much of its <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.</p>
<p>One of the possibilities is <em>mechanical splicing</em>.
Here, one uses a simple kind of alignment device which holds the fiber ends together such that the two <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber cores</a> are well aligned to each other and there is no significant air gap in between the ends.
Once such a splice is applied, the connection should be fairly stable, maintaining a high coupling efficiency even if the connecting fibers are moved.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">The Splicing Process</h2>
<div>
<p>The details of the splicing process depends on the equipment used; one should follow the instructions of the manufacturer.
The process should normally not be too complicated.
A typical process may be as described in the following.</p>
<p>In case that one works with <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber cables</a> instead of simple fibers, the cable ends also need to be prepared appropriately.
Typically, one has to nip through the jacket with a suitable tool, strip off the jacket, and cut off any kevlar to obtain the fiber alone over a length of a few centimeters.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Accurate cleaving is key for obtaining high performance of the splice!</aside>
<p>The fiber ends need to be prepared such that one has clean and flat surfaces, which should be perpendicular to the fiber axis.
First, one has to remove the buffer coating from the fibers over some length.
Thereafter, one needs to clean and <a href="cleaving_of_fibers.html" title="preparing fiber ends with clean optical surfaces by controlled breaking">cleave</a> the ends.
Cleaving is normally sufficient for surface generation, although polishing the fiber ends could lead to even better results.
However, accurate cleaving is key for obtaining high performance of the splice.</p>
<p>One then inserts one of the fibers into the splicing device.
That may contain a transparent window, so that one can monitor the position of the fiber end before finally fixing it by tightening a locking nut.
Thereafter, one carefully inserts the second fiber, until the two ends meet, and fixes that end again with its locking nut.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one applies a thin layer of some <a href="index_matching_fluids.html" title="fluids with a refractive index similar to that of other optical materials, typically used for suppressing light reflections">index matching gel</a> or a transparent epoxy between the fiber ends in order to further reduce the reflection losses.
That should lead to a small <a href="insertion_loss.html" title="power losses due to insertion of a device">insertion loss</a> (e.g. &lt;0.1&nbsp;dB) and also to a large <a href="return_loss.html" title="a measure for how much reflected light is attenuated">return loss</a>, i.e., to negligibly weak reflections at the joint.
The exact width of the gap, filled with the index matching agent, is not critical in this case.
However, this technique is not ideal for splices which are supposed to be removed later on.
Also, one should be sure to have an index matching agent which stays stable over time.</p>
<p>Details may have to be adjusted, or other splicing equipment used, if the fibers have a non-standard diameter.</p>
<p>Depending on the used splicing equipment, the resulting connection may be permanent or removable.
In the latter case, one may only need to clean the fiber ends (particularly if an index matching gel was used), but not to <a href="cleaving_of_fibers.html" title="preparing fiber ends with clean optical surfaces by controlled breaking">cleave</a> them again.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Testing of Splices</h2>
<div>
<p>After splicing, one may want to test the splice quality.
For example, one can use a <em>visual fault locator</em>, which is essentially a visible <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> source.
When some light is launched into the fiber, a poor quality splice will exhibit a lot of stray light, which can be observed if the splicing device is transparent.
In case of a good splice, not much stray light will be seen.</p>
<p>A more elegant method, which however requires expensive equipment, is measuring the <a href="insertion_loss.html" title="power losses due to insertion of a device">insertion loss</a> and the <a href="return_loss.html" title="a measure for how much reflected light is attenuated">return loss</a> with an <a href="optical_time_domain_reflectometers.html" title=" instruments for measuring the spatially resolved reflectivities and losses in optical fibers">optical time-domain reflectometer</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Comparison with Fusion Splicing</h2>
<div>
<p>An alternative to mechanical splicing is <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicing of fibers</a>.
Compared with that, advantages of mechanical splicing are that no expensive equipment is needed, that the process can be tentatively faster, that it can more easily be performed in the field, and that the connection can usually be removed without re-cleaving the fibers.
On the other hand, the splice quality is typically worse in terms of insertion loss and return loss.
Also, the cost per splice (when ignoring the upfront cost of fusion splicing) is higher.</p>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
