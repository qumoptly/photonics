<p class="ref">Ref.: <b>&ldquo;Power scalability as a precise concept for the evaluation of laser architectures&rdquo;</b> in <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/" rel="nofollow">arXiv.org</a>, see <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0711.3987" rel="nofollow">arXiv:0711.3987v1</a>; encyclopedia article on <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling of lasers</a></p>
<p>This week I published the above mentioned paper in the open-access repository arXiv.org.
It is truly amazing that even though the term &ldquo;power scaling&rdquo; has been used for decades in the area of laser technology, this paper is the first (apart from my <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">encyclopedia article</a>) to give a solid definition of power scaling and scalability.
(Anybody not believing this is kindly asked to provide me with a reference proving the opposite.)
The motivation of that work is not only that it is very advisable to use clearly defined terms (rather than vague or even meaningless buzzwords) in science and technology, but also that serious thinking with that concept in mind can inspire a lot of useful thoughts, as common issues of <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high power lasers</a> appear in a new light.
In other areas of technology, such as computing, data storage, communications, and manufacturing, that lesson has been learned much earlier than in laser technology.</p>
<p>In very brief terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>I recommend <em>not</em> to use the term &ldquo;power scaling&rdquo; just for some measure to squeeze somewhat more power out of a laser (even though sadly this has become very common).
True scaling is more specific: it is the application of a <b>systematic, well-defined and repeatable scaling procedure</b> to turn one working laser design into another one with higher output power &ndash; without using additional inventions and without making any of the main challenges more severe.
Precise and practical criteria for power scaling are given in the paper.</li>
<li>The idea is certainly <em>not</em> to dismiss anything which is not true scaling.
In some sense, even the opposite may be supported: the pure application of a systematic procedure, avoiding inventive steps, is not what we call creative work.
However, it can be very creative and productive to recognize or arrange a situation where true scaling is possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are, of course, plenty of reasons to <em>hate</em> this paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who abused the term &ldquo;power scaling&rdquo; in the past, and those who used the term &ldquo;scalable laser architecture&rdquo; for their favorite type of laser, may not like to be told that this was and is not appropriate.</li>
<li>It may be hard to get rid of the feeling that &ldquo;scalability&rdquo; is a kind of quality label which has to be defended for a particular laser under any circumstances.</li>
<li>Even those who have nothing to lose may resist changes in thinking.
Sadly, this is common even in science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I hope the paper will be useful for many.
An aspect which should help is the open-access nature of the arXiv repository.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2009_10_19.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
