<p>There are a lot of misconceptions concerning quasi-three-level lasers, which have once found their way into the scientific and technical literature and do not only persist there, but also occasionally reappear in new publications.
This article addresses some of those.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Reabsorption from the lower laser level kills photons and thus reduces the efficiency of quasi-three-level lasers.</em>&rdquo;
Actually, such reabsorption does remove <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>, but their energy is recycled, as each absorbed photon leaves a laser ion in the upper laser level.
The laser efficiency is only indirectly reduced: reabsorption raises the <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump power</a>, i.e., it makes necessary a higher excitation level of the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> and thus increases the power losses via <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a>.
Also, in <a href="end_pumping.html" title="a technique of optically pumping a laser medium in a direction along the laser beam">end-pumped lasers</a> it doesn't allow to achieve (nearly) complete <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a>, since an overly long <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> will introduce reabsorption toward the weakly pumped end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Bidirectional pumping of three-level gain media helps, since it avoids reabsorption at the weakly pumped end.</em>&rdquo;
Not quite. Assuming a constant pump beam radius along the crystal length and neglecting thermal effects and possible <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a>, it doesn't matter whether the pump power is all applied from one side or from both sides: neither the efficiency of pump absorption nor the contribution of each absorbed milliwatt to the laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> depends on the pump direction.
If reabsorption at a crystal end occurs for single-direction pumping, the crystal is too long (or the <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping level</a> is too high), and this doesn't change when the pump power is split into two beams, each having half the power.
However, bidirectional pumping may make it easier to apply a higher pump power (thus also increasing the optimum crystal length), and the smoother distribution of excitation may reduce thermal and quenching effects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>For modeling a quasi-three-level laser, I have to assume that absorption and emission cross sections at the laser wavelength are equal.</em>&rdquo;
You may believe so when looking at Einstein's original simple model, but <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state gain media</a> exhibit non-degenerate Stark level manifolds with thermal population distributions.
Under such circumstances, one should use <em>effective</em> <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a> which incorporate the thermal population distributions, and in general have different values for absorption and emission.
(In most cases, the absorption cross section is smaller than the emission cross section.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ytterbium-doped lasers are quasi-three-level lasers.</em>&rdquo;
This is true for most, but not for all <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> lasers.
In those lasers operating on relatively long wavelengths &ndash; in particular, some <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> operating at 1100&nbsp;nm and beyond &ndash; there is hardly any reabsorption, and the behavior is in fact hardly different from that of a four-level laser.
However, the long emission wavelength itself is usually enforced by reabsorption effects in situations with a low average excitation level of the ytterbium ions, and can thus be seen as a consequence of three-level behavior.</p>
<p>Associated with such misconceptions is a widespread uncomfortable feeling which probably prevents many companies from exploiting e.g. ytterbium-doped lasers and amplifiers, even in cases where they would be clearly superior.
It can be very worthwhile to get informed about such issues in order to get a wider choice of suitable laser gain media without accepting a higher risk of failure.</p>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
</ul>
