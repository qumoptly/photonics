<p>Various types of optical systems (e.g. <a href="microscope_objectives.html" title="the optical component of a microscope which is next to the observed object">microscope objectives</a> and curved <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a>) can focus or defocus light, and the focal length is used for quantifying such effects.
The simplest case is that of a thin focusing <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> (Figure&nbsp;1a).
If a sufficiently large <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated beam</a> of light is incident on the lens, the beam will be focused, and the focal length is the distance from the lens to that focus (assuming that the lens is surrounded by vacuum or air, not by some dense substance with a significant <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>).
For a defocusing lens (Figure&nbsp;1b), the focal length is the distance from the lens to the <em>virtual focus</em> (indicated by the dashed lines), taken as a negative value.
Some authors use different sign conventions, however, in particularly concerning the front and back focal length (see below).</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Focal Length of a Thin or Thick Lens</h2>

<p>An ideal thin lens with a given focal length <span class="eqn_il"><i>f</i></span> (taken as positive in case of a focusing lens) creates a radially varying <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> delay for a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> according to the following equation:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/dphi_lens.gif" width="109" height="44" alt="radial phase change at lens"></div>
<p>This formula ignores the constant part of the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phase</a> change as well as <a href="optical_aberrations.html" title="degradations of optical images caused in imaging instruments">optical aberrations</a>.</p>
<p>The following equation allows one to calculate the <a href="dioptric_power.html" title="the inverse of the focal length">dioptric power</a> and thus the focal length of <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> made of a <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">material</a> with <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>n</i></span> and with curvature radii <span class="eqn_il"><i>R</i><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="eqn_il"><i>R</i><sub>2</sub></span> on the two surfaces:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/f_lens.gif" width="218" height="50" alt="focal length of a lens"></div>
<p>The curvature radii are taken as positive values for convex surfaces and negative for concave surfaces.
Positive results are obtained for focusing lenses, negative results for defocusing lenses.
The last term is relevant only for thick lenses with substantial curvature on both sides.
The formula delivers the focal length within the <a href="paraxial_approximation.html" title="a frequently used approximation, essentially assuming small angular deviations of the propagation directions from some beam axis">paraxial approximation</a>, not considering <a href="spherical_aberrations.html" title="optical aberrations resulting from spherical optical surfaces">spherical aberrations</a>, for example.</p>
<p>The equation holds for <a href="paraxial_approximation.html" title="a frequently used approximation, essentially assuming small angular deviations of the propagation directions from some beam axis">paraxial</a> rays, not too far from the symmetry axis.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Focal Length of an Extended Optical System</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout red">It is not obvious how to define the focal length of an extended system &ndash; there are different possibilities!</aside>
<p>For an optical system, which may consist of multiple lenses and other optical elements, the above definition of the focal length cannot be used, as it is not clear a priori for an extended system where to measure the distance to the focus: from the entrance into the optical system, from the exit, the middle, or some other position?
In principle, an arbitrary definition of a reference point (e.g. the entrance or the middle) could be used, but that would in general mean that some common rules can not be applied, which e.g. hold for the radius of the <a href="beam_waist.html" title="location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a> at a focus behind some lens with a given focal length (see below), or the possible <a href="magnification.html" title="the enlargements of images">magnification</a> of a <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescope</a> containing that optical system.</p>
<p>A common (but not universally used) approach for the definition of focal lengths of extended systems is based on <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">geometrical optics</a>.
For finding the <em>front</em> <a href="focal_points_and_focal_planes.html" title="points to which parallel input rays are concentrated by an optical system, and the planes going through those points"><em>focal point</em></a>, one calculates rays which are horizontal on the back side (see Figure&nbsp;2), using the <a href="paraxial_approximation.html" title="a frequently used approximation, essentially assuming small angular deviations of the propagation directions from some beam axis">paraxial approximation</a>.
The optical system is considered as a &ldquo;black box&rdquo;, where one does not care about the actual ray paths; instead, one works with internal rays which are extrapolated from the outer rays.
Based on those extrapolated rays, one can define the <em>front</em> <a href="principal_points_and_principal_planes.html" title="planes from which rays appear to be deflected in an optical system according to paraxial optics, and the intersections of those planes with the optical axis"><em>principal plane</em></a> (or <em>first principal plane</em>).
The <em>front focal length</em> is then the distance between the front focal point (in the front <a href="focal_points_and_focal_planes.html" title="points to which parallel input rays are concentrated by an optical system, and the planes going through those points">focal plane</a>) and the front <a href="principal_points_and_principal_planes.html" title="planes from which rays appear to be deflected in an optical system according to paraxial optics, and the intersections of those planes with the optical axis">principal plane</a> (see Figure&nbsp;2).
Some authors define the focal length to be negative in the situation of Figure&nbsp;2, because the focal point is located <em>before</em> the front principal plane; others take the absolute value.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/front_focus.png" alt="front focal length">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
The front focal point is related to parallel rays on the back side (= output side). The optical input is considered to be on the left side. The ray path within the device is only extrapolated from the outer ray path.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For a defocusing system, the front focal plane can be located on the output side; it contains a virtual focal point.
Again, the focal length is the distance between principal plane and focal plane.</p>
<p>Similarly, one can define the <em>back focal plane</em> (or <em>second focal plane</em>) and <em>back principal plane</em> (or <em>second principal plane</em>), where horizontal rays occur on the left side, while on the right side one has converging rays for a focusing system and diverging rays for a defocusing system.
If the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> is the same on the input and output side (e.g. &approx;1 for air), the front focal length and back focal length are identical (apart from possible sign differences used by some authors) and can thus simply called <em>the</em> focal length.
The two principal planes, however, generally do not coincide for thick lenses, and they can even lie outside a lens.</p>
<p>The explained definition delivers a focal length which can also be used in equations for the size of the focus (see below), for example.</p>
<p>Note that the locations of the left and right edges of the optical system (e.g. positions of outer lens surfaces, <a href="optical_windows.html" title="flat transparent plates with optical quality, used for protection against the environment">optical windows</a> etc.) or its housing are not relevant for those definitions.</p>
<p>Different sign conventions for focal lengths are used in the literature.
For example, one may have a negative front focal length if the front focal point lies before the front principal plane.
Obviously, any equations involving focal lengths should be used with the assumed sign conventions.</p>
<p>See also the article on <a href="principal_points_and_principal_planes.html" title="planes from which rays appear to be deflected in an optical system according to paraxial optics, and the intersections of those planes with the optical axis">principal planes</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Focal Distances</h2>
<div>
<p>In contrast to focal lengths, <a href="focal_distance.html" title="the distance between an objective and its focal point"><em>focal distances</em></a> are related not to the <a href="principal_points_and_principal_planes.html" title="planes from which rays appear to be deflected in an optical system according to paraxial optics, and the intersections of those planes with the optical axis">principal planes</a> but rather to the vertex points of lenses (not caring about a housing, which may be further extended).
The front focal distance is thus the distance between front focal point and the entrance surface of the optics, while the back focal distance is the distance between the back surface and the back focal point.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Focal distances are sometimes confused with focal lengths!</aside>
<p>Unfortunately, the terms are also used differently by other authors.
For example, it happens that a focal distance is assumed to be the same as a focal length.
Therefore, some product catalogs specify focal lengths, which should actually be called focal distances, and in addition the <em>effective focal length</em>.</p>
<p>The focal distance should also not be confused with the <a href="working_distance.html" title="the distance between an objective and the object">working distance</a>, which is the distance between a specimen and the lens housing.
Note that a specimen is not necessarily placed in the focal plane, e.g. when the input light to an objective is not <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Effective Focal Length of a Photographic Objective</h2>
<div>
<p>Considerable confusion arises from the fact that in the context of <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photo cameras</a> the term <em>effective focal length</em> is also used with a completely different meaning, as explained in the following.</p>
<p>The angle of view of the <a href="cameras.html" title="optical instruments for recording still or moving images">camera</a> is determined by the ratio of the image size on the film and the focal length.
Film-based cameras have for a long time mostly used 35-mm film (also called 135 film according to ISO Standard 1007), where the image size on the film is typically 36&nbsp;mm&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;24&nbsp;mm.
(The width of the film spool is 35&nbsp;mm, somewhat larger than 24&nbsp;mm, as the picture does not extend to the edges of the spool.)
A standard objective then has a focal length of 50&nbsp;mm.
However, modern digital cameras (particularly the more compact ones) often contain <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensors</a> which are smaller than 36&nbsp;mm&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;24&nbsp;mm, so that an objective lens with a correspondingly smaller focal length (e.g. 32&nbsp;mm instead of 50&nbsp;mm) is required for obtaining the same <a href="field_of_view.html" title="the angular extent of the field which can be observed with an optical instruments or the eye">field of view</a>.
As many photographers are still used to the previously valid relation between focal length and angle of view, it has become common to specify the <em>effective focal length</em> of an objective of a digital camera as that focal length which would give the same angle of view in combination with ordinary 35-mm film.
For example, an objective with a true focal length of 32&nbsp;mm may then be said to have an effective focal length of 50&nbsp;mm and thus function as a standard objective, rather than e.g. a macro or tele objective.</p>
<p>It can be expected that this type of conversion will be abandoned as 35-mm film becomes less and less common.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Systems with an Adjustable Focal Length</h2>
<div>
<p>For some applications, in particular for focusing of <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> systems, it is essential than the focal length of an optical system can be fine adjusted.
The following physical principles can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a lens is made of deformable material, applying some mechanical pressure can alter its shape, and this can change the focal length.
This principle is used in the eye's lens.
The focal length is somewhat reduced for focusing on nearby objects.</li>
<li>When an optical system contains multiple optical elements (e.g. lenses), the focal length may be tuned by adjusting the relative distances between the optical elements.
This principle is used e.g. in photographic zoom objectives.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Wavelength Dependence of the Focal Length; Using Curved Mirrors</h2>
<div>
<p>Ordinary lenses, working on the basis of <a href="refraction.html" title="the change of the propagation direction when a wave comes from one medium into another one">refraction</a>, have a focal length which is slightly wavelength-dependent due to the wavelength dependence of the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> (&ndash;> <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>).
This effect leads to <a href="chromatic_aberrations.html" title="image distortions caused by wavelength-dependent optical effects"><em>chromatic aberrations</em></a> of imaging systems and similar problems in other applications where an optical system is used for a wide range of optical wavelengths.
Lens combinations (e.g., objectives for photographic cameras) can be designed such that chromatic aberrations are minimized.
Most common is the use of <a href="achromatic_optics.html" title="optical devices or setups with minimized chromatic aberrations"><em>achromatic doublets</em></a>, i.e., lenses consisting of two different <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">glass</a> materials chosen such that the overall chromatic aberrations are largely canceled.</p>
<p>One may eliminate <a href="chromatic_aberrations.html" title="image distortions caused by wavelength-dependent optical effects">chromatic aberrations</a> altogether by using optical systems with mirrors only.
A curved mirror with radius of curvature <span class="eqn_il"><i>R</i></span> has a focal length <span class="eqn_il"><i>f</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>R</i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;2</span> (for normal incidence), determined only by the geometry and thus independent of the wavelength.
On the other hand, for non-normal incidence the focal length in the tangential direction is decreased by the cosine of the angle of incidence, and increased by the inverse cosine of that angle in the sagittal direction.
Therefore, such mirrors can introduce <a href="astigmatism.html" title="a kind of optical aberrations; alternatively, a defect of optical lenses or a property of laser beams">astigmatism</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Dioptric Power</h2>
<div>
<p>The <em>dioptric power</em> (also called <em>focusing power</em>) of a lens is defined as the inverse of the effective focal length (which is the same is the front and back focal length if the median on both sides of the optics is the same).
This means that a strongly focusing lens has a small focal length, but a large dioptric power.
For prescription glasses, it is common the specify the dioptric power, whereas the focal length is specified for standard <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>, <a href="microscope_objectives.html" title="the optical component of a microscope which is next to the observed object">microscope objectives</a>, and <a href="photographic_objectives.html" title="objective lenses used for photography">photographic objectives</a>.</p>

Illustration of the lens equation.

</figure>
<p>If a divergent (rather than collimated) beam hits a focusing lens, the distance <span class="eqn_il"><i>b</i></span> from the lens to the focus becomes larger than <span class="eqn_il"><i>f</i></span> (Figure&nbsp;2).
The <em>lens equation</em> states that</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/lens_equation.gif" width="69" height="41" alt="lens equation"></div>
<p>where <span class="eqn_il"><i>a</i></span> is the distance from the original focus to the lens.
This shows that <span class="eqn_il"><i>b&thinsp;&asymp;&thinsp;f</i></span> if <span class="eqn_il"><i>a&thinsp;&gt;&gt;&thinsp;f</i></span>, but <span class="eqn_il"><i>b&thinsp;&gt;&thinsp;f</i></span> otherwise.
That relation can be intuitively understood: a focusing power <span class="eqn_il">1&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>a</i></span> would be required to collimate the incident beam (i.e. to remove its <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>), so that only a focusing power <span class="eqn_il">1&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>f&thinsp;&minus;</i>&thinsp;1&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>a</i></span> is left for focusing.</p>
<p>If <span class="eqn_il"><i>a&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;f</i></span>, the equation cannot be fulfilled: the lens can then not focus the beam.</p>

<p>The equation shows that what determines the minimum possible beam radius is not the focal length <span class="eqn_il"><i>f</i></span> alone, but rather the ratio of <span class="eqn_il"><i>f</i></span> to the radius of the open <a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">aperture</a> of the lens, which sets a maximum to the input beam radius <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>0</sub></span>.
For a focusing or collimation lens, that ratio is essentially the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber"><em>numerical aperture</em></a> of the lens.</p>
<p>Whether this rule can also be applied to an extended optical system with focal length <span class="eqn_il"><i>f</i></span> depends on the applied definition of <span class="eqn_il"><i>f</i></span>.
It is useful to specify an <em>effective focal length</em> which is valid for such relations.</p>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
