<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> laser (<em>carbon dioxide laser</em>) is a <a href="molecular_lasers.html" title="gas lasers where the laser-active gas consists of molecules rather than separate atoms or ions">molecular</a> <a href="gas_lasers.html" title="lasers with a gas (or plasma) as gain medium">gas laser</a> based on a gas mixture as the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>, which contains carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), helium (He), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), and possibly some hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), water vapor and/or xenon (Xe).
Such a laser is electrically pumped via an electrical gas discharge, which can be operated with DC current, with AC current (e.g. 20&ndash;50&nbsp;kHz) or in the radio frequency (RF) domain.
Nitrogen molecules are excited by the electric discharge into a <a href="metastable_states.html" title="excited states (particularly electronic states in laser gain media) which have a relatively long lifetime due to slow radiative and non-radiative decay">metastable</a> vibrational level and transfer their excitation energy to the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules when colliding with them.
The exited CO<sub>2</sub> molecules then largely participate in the laser transition.
Helium serves to depopulate the lower laser level and to remove the heat.
Other constituents such as hydrogen or water vapor can help (particularly in sealed-tube lasers) to reoxidize carbon monoxide (formed in the discharge) to carbon dioxide.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> lasers typically emit at a <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> of 10.6&nbsp;&mu;m, but there are other <a href="spectral_lines.html" title="narrow spectral features related to emission or absorption lines of certain substances">spectral lines</a> in the region of 9&ndash;11&nbsp;&mu;m (particularly at 9.6&nbsp;&mu;m).
In most cases, average output powers are between some tens of watts and many kilowatts.
The <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">power conversion efficiency</a> can be well above 10&#37;, i.e., it is higher than for most <a href="gas_lasers.html" title="lasers with a gas (or plasma) as gain medium">gas lasers</a> (due to a particularly favorable excitation pathway), also higher than for <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">lamp-pumped</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>, but lower than for many <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped lasers</a>.</p>
<p>Due to their high output powers and long emission wavelengths, CO<sub>2</sub> lasers require high-quality <a href="infrared_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems which are suitable for infrared light">infrared optics</a>, often made of materials like zinc selenide (ZnSe) or zinc sulfide (ZnS).</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">CO<sub>2</sub> Laser Types</h2>
<div>
<p>The family of CO<sub>2</sub> lasers is very diverse:</p>
<ul>
<li>For laser powers between a few watts and a several hundred watts, it is common to use <em>sealed-tube</em> or <em>no-flow lasers</em>, where the laser bore and gas supply are contained in a sealed tube.
Such lasers are compact and rugged, and reach operation lifetimes of several thousands of hours.</li>
<li>High-power <em>diffusion-cooled slab lasers</em> (not to be confused with <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="slab_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers where the gain medium has the form of a slab">slab lasers</a>) have the gas in a gap between a pair of planar water-cooled RF electrodes.
The excess heat is efficiently transferred to the electrodes by diffusion, if the electrode spacing is made small compared with the electrode width.
Several kilowatts of output are possible.</li>
<li><em>Fast axial flow lasers</em> and <em>fast transverse flow lasers</em> are also suitable for multi-kilowatt continuous-wave output powers.
The excess heat is removed by the fast-flowing gas mixture, which passes an external cooler before being used again in the discharge.</li>
<li><em>Transverse excited atmosphere (TEA) lasers</em> have a very high (about atmospheric) gas pressure.
As the voltage required for a longitudinal discharge would be too high, transverse excitation is done with a series of electrodes along the tube.
TEA lasers are operated in pulsed mode only, as the gas discharge would not be stable at high pressures.
They often produce average output powers below 100&nbsp;W, but can also be made for powers of tens of kilowatts (combined with high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a>).</li>
<li>There are <em>gas dynamic CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</em> for multi-megawatt powers (e.g. for anti-missile weapons), where the energy is not provided by a gas discharge but by a chemical reaction in a kind of rocket engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concepts differ mainly in the technique of heat extraction, but also in the gas pressure and electrode geometry used.
In low-power sealed-tube lasers (used e.g. for <a href="laser_marking.html" title="a group of methods for labeling materials with lasers">laser marking</a>), waste heat is transported to the tube walls by diffusion or a slow gas flow.
The <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> can be very high.
High-power CO<sub>2</sub> lasers utilize a fast forced gas convection, which may be in the axial direction (i.e., along the beam direction) or in the transverse direction (for the highest powers).</p>
<p>Due to their high powers and high drive voltages, CO<sub>2</sub> lasers raise serious issues of <a href="laser_safety.html" title="safety of the use of laser devices">laser safety</a>.
However, their long operation wavelength makes them relatively <a href="eye_safe_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting in a wavelength region with relatively low hazards for the human eye">eye-safe</a> at low intensities.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of CO<sub>2</sub> Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> lasers are widely used for laser material processing, in particular for</p>
<ul>
<li>cutting plastic materials, wood, die boards, etc., exhibiting high <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> at 10.6&nbsp;&mu;m, and requiring moderate power levels of 20&ndash;200&nbsp;W</li>
<li>cutting and welding metals such as stainless steel, aluminum or copper, applying multi-kilowatt powers</li>
<li><a href="laser_marking.html" title="a group of methods for labeling materials with lasers">laser marking</a> of various materials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other applications include laser surgery (including ophthalmology) and <a href="distance_measurements_with_lasers.html" title="measurements of distances using laser light">range finding</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Competition with Solid-state Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> lasers used for material processing (e.g. welding and cutting of metals, or laser marking) are in competition with <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> (particularly <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">YAG lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>) operating in the 1-&mu;m wavelength regime.
These shorter wavelengths have the advantages of more efficient absorption in a metallic workpiece, and the potential for beam delivery via <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber cables</a>.
(There are no optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> for high-power 10-&mu;m laser beams.)
The potentially smaller <a href="beam_parameter_product.html" title="product of the beam radius in a focus and the far-field beam divergence">beam parameter product</a> of 1-&mu;m lasers can also be advantageous.
However, the latter potential normally cannot be realized with high-power <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">lamp-pumped lasers</a>, and <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped lasers</a> tend to be more expensive.
For these reasons, CO<sub>2</sub> lasers are still widely used in the cutting and welding business, particularly for parts with a thickness greater than a few millimeters, and their sales make more than 10&#37; of all global laser sales (as of 2013).
This may to some extent change in the future due to the development of high-power <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a> and advanced fiber cables in combination with techniques which exploit the high beam quality of such lasers.</p>
