<p>An RGB source is a light source which emits at the same time red, green and blue light.
Such sources are required mainly for color display applications, for example for large-screen video shows.
A wide range of colors can be obtained by mixing different amounts of red, green and blue light (<em>additive color mixing</em>, see Figure&nbsp;1).
A possible combination of <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> is 630&nbsp;nm for red, 532&nbsp;nm for green, and 465&nbsp;nm for blue light.</p>
<p>Many currently used projection displays (&ldquo;beamers&rdquo;) are based on an <a href="arc_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps based on an electrical arc, or continuously operating gas discharge lamps">arc lamp</a>, combined with various color <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">filters</a>.
While an arc lamp is much cheaper than a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> source of comparable output power, it does not allow for a high <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a>, it has a limited lifetime, and the poor spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> of the output imposes restrictions on the achievable image quality.
Also, the available color space is not very large.
Therefore, laser sources are under investigation that could offer a wider color space, much better spatial coherence (<a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>), and higher power efficiency.
Such RGB laser sources emit light in the form of <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a> &ndash; either one beam for each color, or all colors combined in one beam.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/rgb_mixing.png" alt="RGB mixing">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Additive mixing of red, green and blue light, e.g. by superimposing inputs from three light sources, can lead to <a href="white_light.html" title="light which creates a white color impression">white light</a>, seen in the center. A wide range of other color tones could be achieved by mixing variable intensities of those contributions.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 class="togglediv">Color Perception and the Chromaticity Diagram</h2>
<div>
<p>Color perception is not just an issue of physics, but depends on the workings of our eyes.
The retina of the human eye contains just three different receptors with different sensitivity to light at different wavelengths.
(There is actually a fourth kind of receptor with yet another <a href="spectral_response_of_a_photodetector.html" title="the range of optical wavelengths for which a photodetector is sensitive">spectral response</a> curve, but this is used only for vision at very low light levels.)
The perception of colors is based on registering the relative strength of excitation of the three types of receptors.
Therefore, the perceived colors are projected to an only three-dimensional space.
(Most mammals actually use only two different color receptors, shrinking the color perception even to two dimensions.)
As a result, all perceived colors can be located in a two-dimensional <a href="chromaticity.html" title="an objective specification of measured or calculated colors, used in addition to luminance (brightness)">chromaticity</a> diagram as shown in Figure&nbsp;1, if the possibility of varying the optical intensity of each color is ignored.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/cie1931.png" alt="chromaticity diagram according to CIE 1931">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Chromaticity diagram according to CIE 1931. Monochromatic light with different wavelengths corresponds to the edge of the colored area (wavelength values in nanometers are indicated). Of course, the colors can not be correctly reproduced, because no screen and no printer can reproduce the whole range of colors.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the case of <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>-based RGB sources, the red, green and blue beams usually have a relatively narrow optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, i.e. they are close to <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a>.
In the chromaticity diagram, such beams are associated with points at the border of the colored region (the gamut of human vision).
By mixing, e.g., three monochromatic beams, all those colors can be reproduced which lie in the triangle spanned by the corresponding points.
For comparison, the accessible color range for a cathode tube display, a lamp-based beamer or a color printer is a triangle with the edges lying well inside the diagram, so that the spanned area is usually much smaller.
A significant further improvement of a laser-based projection system would be to add a fourth wavelength.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Color Rendering and Luminous Efficiency</h2>
<div>
<p>The choice of the three wavelengths of an RGB source determines the so-called <a href="color_rendering_index.html" title="a quantity which can be used for estimating how accurately colors can be perceived when using a specific light source"><em>color rendering index</em></a> (CRI), which is a quantitative measure of how well it is possible to judge the color of objects when these are illuminated with <a href="white_light.html" title="light which creates a white color impression">white light</a> consisting (in our case) of the three spectral components.
Further, the choice of wavelengths influences the possible <a href="luminous_efficacy_and_efficiency.html" title="the luminous flux of a light source divided by its the radiant power or its electrical consumption (efficacy); the ratio of reached efficacy to the theoretically possible efficacy (luminous efficiency)"><em>luminous efficacy</em></a> of the source, and the two aspects can be in conflict with each other.
For example, a long wavelength of the red beam is favorable in terms of color rendering, but tends to diminish the luminous efficiency because the human eye's sensitivity drops rapidly with increasing wavelength in that region.</p>
<p>The reason why good color rendering is more difficult with pigments (e.g. of paints, dyes, or inks) than with laser beams is essentially that pigments work on the basis of <em>subtractive color mixing</em>, and this approach does not allow the combination of relatively bright colors with narrow optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidths</a>: if a pigment were to generate a very &ldquo;pure&rdquo; color (close to monochromatic light), it would have to absorb all light outside a narrow wavelength band, and leave only a tiny portion of the incident <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
Conversely, a bright yellow pigment, for example, has to transmit not only yellow, but also a lot of red, orange and green light, as it could otherwise not look bright.
Such a mixture of different wavelengths, however, cannot correspond to a point in the color diagram which is close to the boundary, where the monochromatic beams are located.</p>
<p>Note that the availability of a practical laser-based RGB source would not automatically make it possible to realize projection displays for entertainment with a faithful color rendering in a wide <a href="color_spaces.html" title="mathematical spaces for representing color values">color space</a>.
Video material covering that wide color space would also be required.
Currently used videos are based on a smaller color gamut, so that color information is lost.
The small color gamut of the video may be transformed into a larger gamut for the display, but in that case the color rendering will not be faithful.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Required Power Level and Beam Quality</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> below 1&nbsp;W per color are sufficient for indoor digital projection displays (with not too much ambient light) with a projection area of up to a few square meters.
For hand-held devices, even a few tens of milliwatts are sufficient, although higher power levels are desirable for operation under non-optimum ambient light conditions.
Cinema projectors require 10&nbsp;W per color or more.
Suitable projector technology exists, but the RGB sources have not yet reached sufficient power, maturity and cost effectiveness, e.g. for application in cinemas.
A smaller market with lower sensitivity to cost is the area of flight simulators.</p>
<p>In most cases, RGB sources need to have a reasonable or even good <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, e.g. if the display contains a projector which scans the displayed pixels point by point; here, a sufficiently small pixel size (for high resolution) requires a high beam quality.
For other projector types, the beam quality demands may be lower.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">RGB Sources for Stereo Vision</h2>
<div>
<p>There are special RGB sources which can be used for stereoscopic displays, called 6P RGB sources.
For each of the red, green and blue colors, they have two spectral components which differ in wavelength e.g. by 20&nbsp;nm.
For viewing, one can then use special filter glasses which transmit only one set of wavelengths (R1, G1, B1) for the left eye and another set (R2, G2, B2) for the right eye.
That way, one can produce independent images for the two eyes.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Power Modulation</h2>
<div>
<p>Depending on the type of projector engine, the three components of an RGB source may or may not have to be power-modulated according to the video signal.
Power modulation is most often needed in case of scanning projectors, particularly in the context of low-power miniature devices, where the use of external <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulators</a> is not practical.
The modulation <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> required is typically in the region of tens of megahertz or (for higher resolution) even &gt;&thinsp;100&nbsp;MHz.
This is possible when <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> are used, but not when <a href="doped_insulator_lasers.html" title="lasers with a solid-state gain medium containing a laser-active dopant">doped insulator</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> are involved.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Bandwidth</h2>
<div>
<p>The requirements in terms of optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> can be very different for different applications.
For some applications like <a href="holography.html" title="methods for recording and reconstructing three-dimensional images">holography</a>, single-frequency sources are wanted.
For application in displays, a narrow laser bandwidth can be detrimental, because it can easily lead to disturbing <a href="laser_speckle.html" title="light patterns resulting from the reflection of coherent light at rough surfaces">laser speckle</a> effects.
Although those can also be reduced with special display screens, it is desirable to have a substantial bandwidth of the laser source for such applications.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Other Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>RGB laser sources are not only used for color projection displays, but also in some other areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-power versions are suitable for augmented reality displays.</li>
<li class="ta_left">Some systems can be used for generating full-color digital <a href="holography.html" title="methods for recording and reconstructing three-dimensional images">holograms</a>.</li>
<li class="ta_left">Another application is test &amp; inspection.
Images taken with different colors can provide substantial additional information.</li>
<li class="ta_left">Applications in illumination are also conceivable, although the high cost of RGB lasers normally makes that difficult.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Types of Laser-based RGB Sources</h2>
<div>
<p>Different approaches can be taken to construct RGB sources; the most important ones are discussed in the following.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Combining Three Lasers</h3>
<div>
<p>One possibility is to use three lasers, each emitting light with the wanted color.
The problem is, however, that <a href="visible_lasers.html" title="lasers (or other laser-based light sources) emitting visible light">visible lasers</a> are severely limited in performance compared with their near-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> counterparts.
At least a few hundred milliwatts of nearly diffraction-limited output, which would be sufficient for not too large indoor projection displays, can be generated with red and blue <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>, whereas there is unfortunately no green laser diode with similar performance and a sufficiently long lifetime.
Therefore, the green light usually has to be generated by <a href="intracavity_frequency_doubling.html" title="frequency doubling with a nonlinear crystal within the laser resonator">intracavity frequency doubling</a> with a <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG</a> or <a href="vanadate_lasers.html" title="lasers based on rare-earth-doped yttrium, gadolinium or lutetium vanadate crystals, usually Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>">Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> laser</a> emitting at 1064&nbsp;nm.</p>
<p>There are also RGB sources where not only green light, but also red and blue light are generated with frequency doubling.
Instead of a diode pumped YAG laser as discussed above, one can use <a href="diode_lasers.html" title="semiconductor laser devices based on laser diodes">diode lasers</a> for all colors.
Efficient frequency doubling at moderate power levels (e.g. continuous-wave lasers with powers of the order of 1&nbsp;W) cannot be achieved in a single pass through a nonlinear crystal, but with <a href="resonant_frequency_doubling.html" title="frequency doubling with a nonlinear crystal placed in a resonant enhancement cavity">resonant frequency doubling</a>, provided that <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency lasers</a> are used.
If a <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> cannot directly reach the required optical power level, one can use an <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a>, e.g. a tapered semiconductor amplifier or a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="intracavity_frequency_doubling.html" title="frequency doubling with a nonlinear crystal within the laser resonator">Intracavity frequency-doubled</a> <a href="vertical_external_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="surface-emitting semiconductor lasers with an external laser resonator">VECSELs</a> and devices with single-pass doubling in a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> are also attracting increasing interest for that purpose, because they have the potential for cost-effective mass production.
Here, one uses high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> for pumping semiconductor chips, which are the gain media of lasers with external <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonators</a>.
Each of those resonators contains a nonlinear crystal and possibly a bandpass filter.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Single Laser, Nonlinear Frequency Conversion</h3>
<div>
<p>Another option is to generate all three colors with a combination of <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a> stages, starting from a single high-power <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state laser</a>.</p>
<p>For example, one may start at 1064&nbsp;nm, generate the 532-nm green light by frequency doubling, use part of it to pump an <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillator</a> emitting a signal e.g. at 631&nbsp;nm (red output) and an idler at 920&nbsp;nm.
The latter can be frequency-doubled to obtain blue light at 460&nbsp;nm.</p>
<p>The frequency conversion is greatly simplified if a <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a> is used which generates <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> with a sufficiently high <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a> for efficient single-pass conversion.
For example, such systems based on picosecond <a href="vanadate_lasers.html" title="lasers based on rare-earth-doped yttrium, gadolinium or lutetium vanadate crystals, usually Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>">vanadate lasers</a> have been developed for commercial RGB projection displays with multi-watt output per color.
Also, this concept has been demonstrated with a passively mode-locked <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk</a> Yb:YAG laser at 1030&nbsp;nm, generating multi-watt average output powers for all colors [3].</p>
<p>There are many other possible schemes, involving different combinations of parametric oscillators, frequency doublers, <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">sum frequency mixers</a>, and the like.
The evaluation and comparison of such conversion schemes are a complex task, since the performance of the different nonlinear conversion stages depends not only on the crystal materials but also on optical <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">(peak) powers</a>, <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a>, and <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase-matching</a> issues.</p>
<p>A possible problem with this approach is that the optical wavelengths for the different colors cannot be independently optimized.
For example, a longer wavelength for the red light may lead to a shorter wavelength for the blue light, no longer being in the ideal range.</p>

<li>excitation densities of laser-active ions</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and this at any location and time, with arbitrary resolution!</p>
<p>If you had this, finally you could</p>

<li>fully understand what goes on in your laser,</li>
<li>quickly identify and fix any problems, and</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">make faster progress <br> while saving a lot of money.</span></li>
