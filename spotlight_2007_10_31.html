<p>Author: <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/paschotta.html" rel="author">Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta</a>, <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/">RP Photonics Consulting GmbH</a></p>
<p>Abstract: The article considers the question in which sense a laser gain medium, such as a laser crystal, is in thermal equilibrium during laser operation.</p>
</div>
<figure class="right" style="width:130px;">

<p>It is instructive to think about the question whether or not &ndash; or better in which sense &ndash; a <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> of a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>, such as a <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>, is in thermal equilibrium during laser operation.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Temperature Distribution</h2>
<div>
<p>The simplest aspect is that of the temperature distribution within the crystal material.
Quite obviously, we cannot have thermal equilibrium in this respect, which would mean the same temperature everywhere.
That condition would imply zero heat flow, while there is certainly some heat generated in the laser process, and this heat must flow somewhere.
Unfortunately, the inevitable temperature gradients give rise to detrimental phenomena such as <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Electronic States</h2>
<div>
<p>We can also consider the electronic states, first looking only at populations of different Stark level manifolds.
In <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG</a>, for example, we usually have appreciable population densities only in two different states: the metastable upper laser level (<sup>4</sup>F<sub>3/2</sub>) and the ground state (<sup>4</sup>I<sub>9/2</sub>).
In thermal equilibrium, the population of the upper laser level is always smaller than that of the ground state &ndash; a <a href="population_inversion.html" title="a state of a medium where a higher-lying electronic level has a higher population than a lower-lying level">population inversion</a> as required for a positive laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> does not occur, even at very high temperatures.
So during laser operation we need to have a non-equilibrium state here.
Formally, this can be described as a <em>negative temperature</em> inserted into a Boltzmann distribution, but that doesn't cure the problem that a Boltzmann distribution actually applies only in thermal equilibrium, which we don't have here.</p>
<p>By the way, it is <em>not</em> that the population of the upper laser level would approach 50&#37; at high temperatures (and without optical fields around).
Why not? Because both involved Stark level manifolds actually consist of multiple Stark levels, and the ground state manifold (<sup>4</sup>I<sub>9/2</sub>) has more of those.</p>
<p>Despite all what has been said above, you can find plenty of Boltzmann factors in the literature on <a href="laser_modeling.html" title="the investigation of phenomena and quantitative relations in lasers, using theoretical models and computational methods">laser models</a>.
These then usually apply to the distribution of population over the different Stark levels within the same Stark level manifold.
Interestingly, we can easily have a thermal equilibrium within each Stark level manifold, even if there is definitely no thermal equilibrium between those manifolds.
This is because phonons (lattice vibrations) induce very rapid transitions between those Stark levels within one manifold, enforcing the equilibrium within picoseconds, while transitions between different level manifolds require much longer time scales.
These longer time scales also depend very much on the conditions: they are not that long if the energy difference between two adjacent manifolds is at most a few phonon energies, so that rapid <a href="multi_phonon_transitions.html" title="transitions between electronic levels of atoms or ions in solid media, involving the emission of multiple phonons">multi-phonon transitions</a> can take place.
Otherwise, they can be larger by orders of magnitude.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">A Special Case</h2>
<div>
<p>There are some very special cases, where such a thermal equilibrium between closely spaced Stark level manifolds is not established in time.
Consider the amplification of an <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a> in a laser crystal, with the <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a> being of the order of the <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation energy</a> or larger.
The process of <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a> will very rapidly transfer laser-active ions from the upper-state manifold to the manifold of the lower laser level.
Multi-phonon processes may not be fast enough to remove the ions from the lower laser level before reabsorption can take place.
The result of this is that the <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">saturation</a> of the laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> is stronger than normal for some short time, and after that the gain partially recovers on a time scale of e.g. a few nanoseconds, depending on the rate of multi-phonon emission.
That later gain recovery doesn't help, as the amplified pulse is gone by then.
Therefore, the performance e.g. of some <a href="regenerative_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with a resonator in which a light pulse can do multiple round trips before being coupled out">regenerative amplifiers</a> is somewhat worse than expected without having that saturation effect in mind.
The problem does <em>not</em> occur in <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a> of the laser crystal, or for smaller pulse energies, or for much longer pulses.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2009_10_19.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
