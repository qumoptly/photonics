<p>Fluorescence is a short-lived <a href="photoluminescence.html" title="emission of light which is caused by the irradiation of a material with other light">photoluminescence</a>, excited by irradiation of a substance with light.
The light hitting a sample puts atoms, ions or molecules in the sample into excited states (by <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> of <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>), from where they decay into lower-lying states (e.g. their ground states) through <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> of fluorescence photons.
This phenomenon is exploited for illumination, particularly in <a href="fluorescent_lamps.html" title="lamps which emit fluorescent light, usually generated by irradiation of a phosphor with light from an electric gas discharge">fluorescent lamps</a>.
It also occurs at a side effect in various kinds of <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">optically pumped</a> <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> and <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a>, e.g. in <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> doped-insulator lasers and amplifiers (including <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>), in optically pumped <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a>, and in <a href="dye_lasers.html" title="lasers based on liquid or solid dyes as gain media">dye lasers</a>.
The resulting radiation is called <em>fluorescent light</em>.</p>

<a href="upconversion_lasers.html" title="lasers relying on upconversion processes">Upconversion</a> processes lead to the population of relatively high-lying energy levels, from where blue and even <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> is emitted.
Such fibers are suitable for lasing in the blue spectral region near 480&nbsp;nm.
(The weak peaks around 700&nbsp;nm are artifacts, caused by second-order diffraction of ultraviolet light in the <a href="spectrographs.html" title="instruments for spectrally analyzing light">spectrograph</a>. Data taken by R. Paschotta.)

</figure>
<p>Substances emitting fluorescence, or sometimes just parts of larger molecules, are called <em>fluorophores</em>.
Some artificial fluorophores may be added to samples in <a href="fluorescence_spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy which is based on the analysis of fluorescence light">fluorescence spectroscopy</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Emission Spectrum</h2>
<div>
<p>The <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> of fluorescence light (see e.g. Figure&nbsp;1) generally differs from that of the light which initially caused the excitation of the medium.
A significant <a href="stokes_shift.html" title="the reduction in photon energy in certain processes">Stokes shift</a> (difference in <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> energies of absorbed and emitted light) can occur because a part of the excitation energy is converted to heat in the medium.
For example, the excited atoms or ions may first undergo an optical or a <a href="non_radiative_transitions.html" title="transitions between energy levels of atoms or ions which are not associated with the emission of light">non-radiative transition</a> to some intermediate level, before emitting fluorescence light in a transition to the ground state, or to some higher-lying energy level.
It is also possible that a cascade of emission processes occurs, i.e., a cascade of transitions to lower-lying energy levels; in that case, more than one fluorescence photon can be emitted for one absorbed photon.</p>
<p>In <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state laser</a> <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain media</a>, <a href="phonons.html" title="quantized microscopic vibrations in solid media">phonons</a> lead to very fast thermalization within Stark level manifolds.
As the emission occurs on a much longer time scale, the spectral shape of the emission spectrum does not depend on the exact wavelength of the exciting light.</p>
<p>Cases with <em>resonance fluorescence</em> &ndash; most often with atoms or molecules &ndash; are those not involving additional transitions, where the interacting atoms or molecules can be considered as simple oscillators with a certain resonance frequency.
The emission wavelengths are then close to the excitation wavelength.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fluorescence Decay</h2>
<div>
<p>After excitation with a short <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a>, the fluorescence decay is often of exponential nature with a decay constant which is called the <em>fluorescence lifetime</em> or <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level"><em>upper-state lifetime</em></a> (because the fluorescence lifetime is identical to the lifetime of the population in the upper level of an electronic transition).
For so-called <em>allowed transitions</em>, the fluorescence lifetime is typically of the order of a few nanoseconds.
In solid-state laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain media</a> other than semiconductors, one is often dealing with <a href="forbidden_transitions.html" title="transitions between different energy levels of some atoms or ions for which dipole transitions are suppressed via symmetries">weakly allowed transitions</a>, where the fluorescence lifetime can be much longer, e.g. microseconds or even milliseconds.</p>
<p>For very long decay times, usually involving triplet states with <a href="forbidden_transitions.html" title="transitions between different energy levels of some atoms or ions for which dipole transitions are suppressed via symmetries">forbidden transitions</a>, such luminescence is called <a href="phosphorescence.html" title="a luminescence which lasts for a relatively long time after excitation of a medium"><em>phosphorescence</em></a>.
Is also the phenomenon of <em>delayed fluorescence</em>, which can involve a weak intersystem crossing to a triplet state and later back to the original singlet state.</p>
<p>Various processes can lead to pronounced <em>non-exponential fluorescence decay</em>, with a faster decay shortly after excitation and a slower decay later.
For example, this can be caused by contributing atoms with different lifetimes, or by <a href="upconversion.html" title="a process where light can be emitted with photon energies higher than those of the light generating the excitation">upconversion</a> processes which are stronger for high level populations.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Competing Non-radiative Processes</h2>
<div>
<p>In many cases, there are <a href="non_radiative_transitions.html" title="transitions between energy levels of atoms or ions which are not associated with the emission of light">non-radiative</a> processes which compete with fluorescence and reduce or even fully suppress it (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects"><em>quenching</em></a>).
In particular, <a href="multi_phonon_transitions.html" title="transitions between electronic levels of atoms or ions in solid media, involving the emission of multiple phonons">multi-phonon transitions</a> are very strong for level pairs with an energy distance which is at most a few times the maximum phonon energy of the host material.
In other cases, <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfer</a> processes can deplete the population of a metastable level.</p>
<p>The <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect"><em>quantum efficiency</em></a> (or <em>quantum yield</em>) of fluorescence from some level is the average number of fluorescence <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a> obtained per ion which is put into the upper level.
Solid-state <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain media</a> (e.g. <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> or <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>) often have <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transitions</a> with a quantum efficiency very close to unity, whereas some levels (e.g. the lower laser level) exhibit virtually no fluorescence due to strong multi-phonon transitions.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fluorescence in Lasers and Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p>In the context of <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>, fluorescence in the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> (or other <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>) by <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> is lost for the laser operation, because only a tiny fraction of it goes into the laser <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator mode</a>.
The fluorescence lifetime for fluorescence from the upper laser level is usually called the <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level"><em>upper-state lifetime</em></a>.
Fluorescence is the most fundamental reason why a certain <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">laser threshold</a> has to be overcome to achieve lasing (exception: <a href="thresholdless_lasers.html" title="lasers with a threshold power which is virtually zero"><em>thresholdless lasers</em></a>).
Note also that when the pump source of a laser is turned on, laser action normally starts from a tiny amount of fluorescence in the laser resonator mode, amplified to high levels in many resonator round trips.</p>
<p>In optical <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a>, fluorescence can be even more important.
In the form of <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> (ASE), it may extract significant power and thus limit the achievable <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>.
It also determines much of the <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a> contributions to <a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a> and <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">amplifier noise</a>.</p>
<p>Fluorescence can be very important for the characterization of laser gain media:</p>
<ul>
<li>It indicates any radiative transitions from metastable levels (not only the upper laser level) and can be used for the measurement of the emission <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, and thus also the <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a>.
Note, however, that reabsorption losses in <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level gain media</a> and also <a href="excited_state_absorption.html" title="absorption of light by ions or atoms in an excited electronic state, rather than in the electronic ground state">excited-state absorption</a> can cause the gain bandwidth to be smaller than that obtained from fluorescence spectra.</li>
<li>When the <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a> can be assumed to be near unity, the <a href="fuchtbauer_ladenburg_equation.html" title="an equation used for calculating emission cross sections of laser gain media">FÃ¼chtbauer&ndash;Ladenburg equation</a> and similar tools can be used to calculate the magnitude of emission <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a>.
Additional data concerning absorption can be obtained via <a href="mccumber_theory.html" title="a theory applied to absorption and emission properties of laser gain media, in particular to solid-state media">McCumber theory</a>.</li>
<li>The temporal decay of the fluorescence after excitation (e.g. with a short <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a>) can be measured in order to quantify the level lifetimes, in particular the <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>.</li>
<li>Fluorescence may reveal the presence of impurities, e.g. unwanted rare earth ions, and also parasitic processes such as cooperative luminescence.</li>
<li>In <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a>, monitoring fluorescence intensities along the fiber allows the determination of parameters such as the <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fluorescent light is also sometimes used for aligning a laser.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Application in Lighting</h2>
<div>
<p>Fluorescence is widely used in <em>fluorescent tubes</em> for illumination purposes.
The most common <a href="fluorescent_lamps.html" title="lamps which emit fluorescent light, usually generated by irradiation of a phosphor with light from an electric gas discharge">fluorescent lamps</a> contain mercury vapor inside a glass tube, where an electric discharge excites the mercury atoms to emit mostly <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>.
A fluorescent material (called the <a href="phosphors.html" title="substances which exhibit luminescence, used mostly for illumination and displays"><em>phosphor</em></a>) on the inner surface of the tube absorbs the ultraviolet light and converts it into fluorescence light, mostly in the visible spectral region.
The phosphor contains several substances mixed in such a way that the overall emission spectrum corresponds to <a href="white_light.html" title="light which creates a white color impression">white light</a> (with the color tone adjusted according to the envisaged application).
Although part of the energy of the ultraviolet light is lost in the phosphor, fluorescence lights are still several times more energy-efficient than <a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">incandescent lamps</a>.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diodes</a> (LEDs) which generate white light in a process that involves the excitation of a phosphor.
In that case, however, the actual LED produces blue rather than ultraviolet light, and this blue light is partly converted to red and green fluorescence light in the phosphor, and partly emitted by the device.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Application in Solar Concentrators for Photovoltaics</h2>
<div>
<p>Fluorescence in transparent polymer sheets, which are doped with some luminescent species, can be used for <em>luminescent (or fluorescent) solar concentrators</em> [2].
Sunlight hitting the polymer sheets from any direction can be absorbed and efficiently transformed into fluorescent light, which is partly trapped in the sheets and thus sent to the edges, where solar cells receive the concentrated radiation.
Potentially suitable luminescent agents can be certain organic dyes and <a href="quantum_dots.html" title="microscopic structures confining charge carriers in three dimensions">quantum dots</a>.
Further research is required to optimize the still limited lifetime of dyes under irradiation with sunlight and the <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a> of quantum dots.</p>
<p>Fluorescent solar concentrators might be the basis for cheaper electricity from photovoltaic panels, as they allow to collect radiation from a large area while requiring only relatively small photovoltaic cells.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Using Fluorescence in Other Ways</h2>
<div>
<p>Fluorescence light can be useful, e.g. for direct use for optical measurements, such as for measuring the transmission spectra of optical devices.
It is also the basis of <a href="fluorescence_spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy which is based on the analysis of fluorescence light">fluorescence spectroscopy</a>, <a href="fluorescence_microscopy.html" title="a technique for acquiring microscopic images using fluorescence which is excited in the sample">fluorescence microscopy</a> and of <a href="optical_refrigeration.html" title="a technique for cooling macroscopic samples via laser-induced fluorescence">optical refrigeration</a>.
By combining multiple types of emitting <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare earth ions in an optical fiber</a>, very broadband radiation can be generated [1].</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Interactions via Fluorescence</h2>
<div>
<p>Fluorescence of the single atoms, ions or molecules of a sample usually occurs in an uncoordinated manner, i.e., uniformly in all spatial directions and without temporal correlations between the emitted photons.
However, certain conditions lead to <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified"><em>amplified spontaneous emission</em></a> (<a href="superluminescence.html" title="fluorescence which is enhanced by laser amplification"><em>superluminescence</em></a>) or <a href="superfluorescence.html" title="collective emission of radiation by an ensemble of excited atoms or ions"><em>superfluorescence</em></a>, where this is no longer the case.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Parametric Fluorescence</h2>

<p>A special kind of fluorescence, which is not related to the excitation of atoms or ions in a substance, is <a href="parametric_fluorescence.html" title="emission of light by a parametric amplifier without signal or input inputs"><em>parametric fluorescence</em></a> in <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a>.
This effect does not involve the excitation of electrons in the media, but rather a nonlinear interaction.
Such fluorescence occurs only as long as some pump light propagates in the medium.</p>

<h2>Free Tutorial: Modeling of Fiber Amplifiers and Lasers</h2>
<p>We have published a new <a href="./tutorial_modeling.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">tutorial</a> which discusses the modeling of fiber amplifiers and lasers.
It addresses many questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a <a href="./tutorial_modeling1.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">model</a>?</li>
<li>Should one use <a href="./tutorial_modeling3.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">power propagation or field propagation</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate the behavior of <a href="./tutorial_modeling4.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">laser-active ions</a>?</li>
<li>How to calculate <a href="./tutorial_modeling5.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">steady-state solutions</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate <a href="./tutorial_modeling6.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">dynamical behavior</a> and <a href="./tutorial_modeling7.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">ultrashort pulse propagation</a>?</li>
<li>What aspects are important for the <a href="./tutorial_modeling8.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">decision</a> whether to develop own modeling software or use commercial software?</li>
