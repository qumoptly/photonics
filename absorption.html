</header>
<p>Through different kinds of processes, which are explained in the following section, <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> can be absorbed in various media.
This implies that the optical energy is converted into some other form of energy.
In most cases, the energy is eventually transformed into heat (thermal energy).</p>
<p>The term <em>absorption</em> is not only used for absorption processes, but also often for related quantities, e.g. instead of <a href="absorption_coefficient.html" title="a logarithmic measure for the distributed absorption in a medium">absorption coefficient</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Absorption Processes</h2>
<div>
<p>The following kind of physical processes can be involved in the linear absorption of light:</p>
<ul>
<li>In an insulating material, having a certain <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a>, strong linear absorption occurs when the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> energy of the light exceeds the bandgap energy (which is often possible only in the <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> spectral region).
Each absorption of a photon causes the excitation of one electric carrier across the bandgap, so that one obtains one additional carrier in the conduction band and one hole in the valence band.
The electronic excitation energy can subsequently be converted to heat (i.e., to multiple <a href="phonons.html" title="quantized microscopic vibrations in solid media">phonons</a>) or partially to <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> light, often within nanoseconds or even faster.</li>
<li>Strongly linear absorption is also possible at long (<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a>) <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> through <a href="multiphonon_absorption.html" title="absorption processes involving multiple phonons">multiphonon absorption</a>.
For example, in fused silica that happens for wavelength beyond the <em>infrared absorption edge</em> at approximately 2&nbsp;&mu;m.</li>
<li>Similar processes occur in semiconductors, where however the bandgap energy is smaller, so that strong absorption is possible also in the visible spectral region.</li>
<li>The situation is different in metals, where the conduction band is not completely filled.
Due to strong reflection, one can have absorption only within a thin surface layer, which can nevertheless be substantial in certain wavelength regions.
The absorption properties can also depend on the roughness of the surface, and are sometimes intentionally modified by nano-structuring.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also many cases where a material contains some absorbing dopant while the host material itself exhibits only negligible absorption.
This is the case for solid-state (doped-insulator) <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain media</a>.</p>
<p>In some special cases, nearly all of the absorbed light causes <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> rather than heat, and there can be even a net cooling effect (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="laser_cooling.html" title="a variety of techniques for reducing the temperature (i.e., the random motion) of small particles such as atoms or ions"><em>laser cooling</em></a>).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Linear and Nonlinear Absorption</h2>
<div>
<p>Linear absorption means that the <a href="absorption_coefficient.html" title="a logarithmic measure for the distributed absorption in a medium">absorption coefficient</a> is independent of the <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a>.
There are also <em>nonlinear</em> absorption processes, where the absorption coefficient is a linear or higher-order function of the intensity.
For example, <a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">two-photon absorption</a> is a process where two photons are absorbed simultaneously, and the absorption coefficient rises linearly with the intensity.
<a href="multiphoton_absorption.html" title="absorption processes where multiple photons are absorbed simultaneously">Multiphoton absorption</a> processes of higher order are often involved in <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">laser-induced damage</a> caused by intense laser <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a>.</p>
<p><a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">Saturable absorption</a> can also be considered as a kind of nonlinear absorption.
Here, however, the absorption coefficient is <em>reduced</em> under the influence of intense light, e.g. because the starting electronic level for the light absorption is depleted.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Parasitic Absorption</h2>
<div>
<p>In cases where a medium or an optical component should normally not be absorbing, some nevertheless occurring and disturbing amount of absorption is often called <em>parasitic absorption</em> or <em>residual absorption</em>.</p>
<p>Parasitic absorption occurs in <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> and <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a>, for example, as a result of impurities (<em>extrinsic absorption</em>), or sometimes due to multiphonon absorption (<em>intrinsic absorption</em>, not avoidable even with perfect material quality).
For many photonic devices, parasitic absorption limits the power handling capability.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Effects on the Absorbing Medium and its Optical Properties</h2>
<div>
<p>In most cases, absorption of light causes heating of the absorbing medium and subsequently thermal expansion.
The heating is often strongly inhomogeneous; for example, it may occur within a focused <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>.
The local thermal expansion then leads to mechanical stress in the medium, which can even result in fracture when the deposited thermal power or energy is sufficiently high.
Further, the temperature causes a slight local modification of the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>, which (together with stress-related effects) can cause <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> effects.</p>
<p>Further, the modified population of electronic states can modify the absorption at the wavelength of the absorbed light and also at other wavelengths.
It has already been mentioned that absorption may be saturated.
Also, one may obtain <a href="excited_state_absorption.html" title="absorption of light by ions or atoms in an excited electronic state, rather than in the electronic ground state">excited-state absorption</a> at wavelengths where the material would normally not be absorbing.
In semiconductors, at high intensities one obtains free carrier absorption.</p>
<p>At some wavelengths, one may obtain <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> amplification for strong enough excitation of the medium, usually involving a <a href="population_inversion.html" title="a state of a medium where a higher-lying electronic level has a higher population than a lower-lying level">population inversion</a>.
In an optically pumped laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>, sufficiently strong <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> is required, since only absorbed pump light can be utilized.</p>
<p>Absorption of light can also have electrical effects.
For example, there are <a href="photoconductive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which exhibit a reduction in electrical resistance caused by incoming light">photoresistors</a>, where the electrical resistance is reduced by absorbed light.
In <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> and <a href="phototransistors.html" title="a type of semiconductor-based photodetector with internal current amplification for higher responsivity">phototransistors</a>, one exploits the internal <a href="photoelectric_effect.html" title="the emission or excitation of electric carriers related to the absorption of light">photoelectric effect</a>, related to the excitation of electric carriers by light absorption.</p>
<p>If light is absorbed by atoms or molecules of a gas, <a href="light_forces.html" title="forces associated with absorption, reflection or scattering of light">light forces</a> associated with the absorption may become relevant.
They can be used for <a href="doppler_cooling.html" title="a technique of laser cooling based on velocity-dependent absorption processes">Doppler cooling</a>, for example.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Quantifying Absorption</h2>
<div>
<p>Absorption in a semi-transparent medium is usually quantified with an <a href="absorption_coefficient.html" title="a logarithmic measure for the distributed absorption in a medium">absorption coefficient</a>, telling which fraction of the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> is lost per unit length.
The inverse of an absorption coefficient is called an <a href="absorption_length.html" title="the length of which absorption reduces the optical intensity to 1/e of its initial value">absorption length</a>.
The absorption of a given length of material (e.g. of a plate with a certain thickness) can be quantified with an <a href="absorbance.html" title="the logarithm with base 10 of the inverse transmittance">absorbance</a>.</p>
<p>If absorption is caused by some absorbing dopant, the contribution to the absorption per dopant atom or ion is often quantified with an <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">absorption cross section</a>.</p>
<p>As absorption coefficients are wavelength-dependent, one often produces <em>absorption spectra</em>, showing an absorption coefficient as a function of wavelength or <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>.</p>
<p>Non-transparent objects can be attributed an <a href="absorptance.html" title="the fraction of incoming radiant flux which is absorbed by an object">absorptance</a>, which is the fraction of incident light which is absorbed rather than transmitted, reflected or <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattered</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Generation of Quantum Noise via Absorption</h2>
<div>
<p>Even simple linear absorption processes introduce some amount of <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a>.
This can be intuitively understood by considering that some of the incident <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> are randomly removed, while other photons remain in the light beam.
An initially perfectly regular stream of photons (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="amplitude_squeezed_light.html" title="light with an intensity noise below the shot noise level">amplitude-squeezed light</a>) would thus be converted into a random stream of photons, exhibiting some <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a>.</p>
<p>If the incident light is in a <a href="coherent_states.html" title="a special kind of pure quantum-mechanical states of light">coherent state</a>, exhibiting the standard <a href="shot_noise.html" title="quantum-limited intensity noise">shot noise</a> level, the extra noise added through linear absorption is just enough to keep the residual light at the shot noise level (which is relatively stronger for weaker light).</p>
<p>Nonlinear absorption processes can modify quantum noise properties in more complicated ways.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2009_10_19.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
