</header>
<p>For commercially sold lasers and laser systems, it is common to have a set of laser specifications, i.e., of more or less precise descriptions of their properties, as far as these are relevant for the users.
(Internal details, which do not directly affect the user, are usually not specified.)
Such specifications (in short: specs) are made by suppliers of lasers (usually by the manufacturers), but also a buyer will usually write down the required specifications for his <a href="laser_applications.html" title="applications involving laser devices">application</a> before selecting a laser model.
Most aspects of this article apply both to certain laser components and to complete laser systems.</p>
<p>Laser specifications are important for different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The buyer of a laser needs to be informed about the essential properties of a laser system before buying and when applying a system.
Some key performance figures such as output power and beam quality normally need to be guaranteed, and various details must be known for proper application, for example for combining the laser with other devices.</li>
<li>Specifications are often included in quotations and purchase orders in order to define duties of the supplier and conditions for use.
In cases of conflict between user and supplier, specifications may be used to determine whether or not a laser system is delivering what it could be expected to deliver.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">A lot of trouble could be avoided by dealing more diligently with laser specifications.</aside>
<p>For most purposes, it is important that laser specifications are clear and precise, well understandable for all involved parties, and complete.
In practice, specifications are often deficient concerning one or several of these aspects, because insufficient know-how and experience was available for writing them, or the task was carried out with insufficient diligence.
Such deficiencies can cause substantial technical and other problems.
For example, incomplete specifications may make the selection of a laser complicated, create uncertainties for the application of a system, raise unrealistic expectations, or cause errors in the integration of laser products into other machinery.
In cases of conflict, parties may insist on incompatible interpretations of unclear specifications or of the consequences of deviations, and this can contribute to expensive, time-consuming and risky legal conflicts.</p>
<p>Because such problems can be severe, a high degree of diligence is recommended</p>
<ul>
<li>when formulating specifications for an existing product,</li>
<li class="ta_left">when defining the requirements for some application, and</li>
<li class="ta_left">when determining whether a certain system will be suitable for an application.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">Not only a precise technical understanding, but also a broad experience is essential for making complete specifications.</aside>
<p>However, certain important aspects are easily overlooked, particularly when no substantial experience with the type of devices or their application is available.
For example, a user may not be aware of certain typical problems and limitations of certain laser types, while a manufacturer may not be aware of certain critical issues for an application.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Types of Specifications</h2>
<div>
<p>Specifications can address very different aspects, such as performance figures, device lifetime, required ambient condition, and other properties such as dimensions, weight and mounting details.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Performance Specifications</h3>
<div>
<p>It is normally of central importance for the buyer of a laser system that certain performance figures are reached.
What performance figures exactly are relevant, depends both on the details of the system and its application.
Some typically important specifications concern the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The output power must stay within certain limits.
Note that the output power may depend on additional conditions.
For example, for pulsed lasers the average output power may depend on the chosen pulse repetition rate, and for tunable lasers it normally varies with the chosen <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>.</li>
<li>Various properties of the output <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> need to be defined, in particular its transverse size: the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> (or diameter) at the exit from the laser housing, whether the beam is <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated</a>, otherwise (for divergent or convergent beams) where the <a href="beam_waist.html" title="location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a> is located.
Note that different definitions for the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> exist.</li>
<li>The <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> may be specified via the <a href="beam_parameter_product.html" title="product of the beam radius in a focus and the far-field beam divergence">beam parameter product</a> (BPP) or the <a href="m2_factor.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a>.</li>
<li>The polarization may be linear with a given direction (vertical or horizontal).
In other cases, the polarization is undefined, or rarely an unpolarized output is even guaranteed.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout red">It should be made clear whether or how specified values depend on the choice of emission wavelength or pulse repetition rate!</aside>
<ul>
<li>For pulsed lasers, relevant quantities can be the <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a>, <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a> and <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">duration</a>, pulse shape and possibly a <a href="chirp.html" title="time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirp</a>.
If the repetition rate can be varied, specifications of the other pulse parameters may be required for different values of the repetition rate.
(For <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>, for example, higher repetition rates normally imply lower pulse energies and longer pulses.)</li>
<li>The laser wavelength (usually understood as the central wavelength, defined via the &ldquo;center of mass&rdquo;) must stay within certain limits.
For <a href="tunable_lasers.html" title="lasers the output wavelengths of which can be tuned">tunable lasers</a>, a range of wavelength needs to be defined, and how other properties (e.g., the output power) vary in that range, or at least what minimum specifications are valid for that range.</li>
<li>There is often an upper (and sometimes a lower) limit for the optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, which is related to the temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> of the laser light.
One may also specify the limits for the <a href="coherence_length.html" title="a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the propagation distance over which the coherence significantly decays">coherence length</a>.
For example, a sufficiently short coherence length may be required to avoid problems with <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effects.</li>
<li>Various kinds of fluctuations (<a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a>) may be limited.
For example, one may specify the maximum r.m.s. (root mean squared) fluctuations within a certain measurement <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, possible in the form of <a href="relative_intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity (or actually power), normalized to its average value">relative intensity noise</a> (RIN).
<a href="phase_noise.html" title="noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">Phase noise</a> is related to the optical bandwidth (see above), but more comprehensive (frequency-resolved) phase noise specifications may be required in the form of a maximum <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> versus noise frequency.
The <a href="beam_pointing_fluctuations.html" title="fluctuations of the propagation direction of a laser beam">beam pointing stability</a> may be specified as an r.m.s. value of the angular deviations within a certain measurement time and bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, specifications are valid only after a certain warm-up time after switching on a laser system.</p>
<p>Although this list contains all the typically relevant aspects, many additional aspects may also be relevant, depending on details of the laser system and the application.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Laser Safety</h3>
<div>
<p>It is common to define a <a href="laser_safety.html" title="safety of the use of laser devices">laser safety</a> class for a laser source, even though the safety class for the system into which the laser is integrated may be completely different.
If the output power exceeds a certain limit (depending on the wavelength) and the laser beam is accessible, the system will normally be in class IV (the most safety-critical one).
If such a laser is put into a fully enclosed housing, with <a href="interlocks.html" title="safety devices for automatically switching off a laser power or interrupting a laser beam">interlocks</a> etc., the system may still be in the class I, where it can be considered as very safe.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Lifetime Specifications</h3>
<div>
<p>Lasers, as other devices, have only a limited lifetime.
The guaranteed lifetime may be specified as a certain number of years or via some number of operation hours, or possible both combined.
It is normally understood as the time during which the laser fulfills all the performance specifications.
A lifetime guarantee is often subject to additional conditions to be fulfilled by the user: certain ambient conditions need to be ensured (see below), and regular servicing may be required.</p>
<aside class="callout green">What does a guaranteed lifetime mean: guaranteed trouble-free operation or just as many free repairs as required for that operation time?</aside>
<p>Note that quite different interpretations of device lifetimes are possible.
A strict interpretation would be that a laser system has to stay within specifications for the whole lifetime without any unplanned intervention.
For a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a>, which is integrated in an undersea cable, this is very reasonable, since it is hardly possible to perform any service operations after deployment.
For <a href="industrial_lasers.html" title="lasers used for industrial purposes, for example for laser material processing">industrial lasers</a>, however, occasional repairs may be tolerated, if they are not so frequent and/or time-consuming that the severely disturb the intended <a href="laser_applications.html" title="applications involving laser devices">application</a>.
A rather lax interpretation of lifetime guarantee would be that the supplier can make as many repairs as required for reaching an overall long enough time of operation, and resulting interruptions and delays are not considered as problematic.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Ambient Conditions</h3>
<div>
<p>Laser system are often relatively sensitive to ambient conditions.
Some typical aspects are shortly discussed in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ambient temperature (air temperature and/or temperature of the table on which the system is mounted) must remain within certain limits.
Deviations from that condition may lead not only to degraded performance but even to serious damage.</li>
<li>If the laser housing is not hermetically sealed, there may be requirements on how clean the surrounding air needs to be, in what range the relative humidity needs to be, or whether purging e.g. with dry nitrogen gas is needed.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout red">Neglecting cooling water specifications can destroy laser systems!</aside>
<ul>
<li>Many lasers require a <a href="laser_cooling_units.html" title="devices used for cooling of high-power lasers">laser cooling units</a> as a supply of cooling water, with conditions concerning the water pressure, the available water flow, and the chemical composition (e.g., pH value and salt content).
While an interruption or insufficient strength of water flow should trigger an automatic system shut-down, not appropriate chemical condition of the cooling water may lead to permanent damage.
Microchannel coolers of <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> are particularly sensitive to effects of corrosion under such circumstances.
Some isolated laser components or <a href="oem_laser_modules.html" title="laser modules made for integration into larger devices by another manufacturer">OEM laser modules</a> may not have an automatic shutdown at excessive temperatures.</li>
<li>Most lasers should not be exposed to excessive mechanical vibrations.
Precise specifications in that respect are often not given, but at least some indication concerning how well a laser must be protected e.g. against vibrations caused by nearby machinery.</li>
<li>May laser devices are sensitive to back-reflected light.
It might be specified what level of reflections can be tolerated.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Other Properties</h3>
<div>
<p>Various other properties of a laser system can be relevant, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the dimensions of the housing</li>
<li class="ta_left">in case of multiple parts (laser head, power supply, etc.): dimensions of all parts, cable lengths, etc.</li>
<li class="ta_left">the weight</li>
<li class="ta_left">the exact location where the generated laser beam leaves the housing</li>
<li class="ta_left">types of <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber-optic connectors</a> and/or parameters of the output <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a></li>
<li class="ta_left">connections for additional parts such as <a href="interlocks.html" title="safety devices for automatically switching off a laser power or interrupting a laser beam">interlocks</a></li>
<li class="ta_left">electrical specifications for certain inputs (e.g. pulse triggers) and outputs</li>
<li class="ta_left">accessibility of the housing e.g. for service operations</li>
<li class="ta_left">details of the mounting and installation</li>
<li class="ta_left">electrical power requirements, cable lengths</li>
<li class="ta_left">service requirements, e.g. intervals for regular service and/or for replacing consumables</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, not all details may be given in some specification sheet; they may be provided only to those customers who ask for them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Examples for Vague Laser Specifications</h2>
<div>
<p>Many specifications which may look fairly clear at a first glance can nevertheless be quite deficient.
A few examples demonstrate that:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Manufacturers often produce very unclear specifications, and many buyers do not think sufficiently clearly about required specifications. A lot of problems result from such lack of care.</aside>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Output power: 25&nbsp;W&rdquo;: this is probably the lower limit; is there no upper limit?
For a pulsed laser: it is probably the average output power, but is this valid for the full range of pulse repetition rates?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Pulse energy: 50&nbsp;mJ&rdquo;: probably a lower limit; does this only apply for a low enough pulse repetition rate?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Pulse pedestals: &lt;&thinsp;3&#37;&rdquo;: is that a limit for the power or for the energy in pedestals?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Spot size: 2&nbsp;mm &times; 1.5&nbsp;mm&rdquo;: are these beam diameters in horizontal and vertical direction? Measured at which location &ndash; at the laser exit or at some focus position? Is it a full width at half maximum, or measured at <span class="eqn_il">1/<i>e</i><sup>2</sup></span> intensity level or whatever else?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Beam profile: TEM<sub>00</sub>&rdquo;: apparently, the beam is close to a <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a>, but how close?
An upper limit for the <a href="m2_factor.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a> would be more precise.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Divergence angle: &lt;&thinsp;2&nbsp;mrad&rdquo;: is this a full angle or half angle (i.e., against the beam axis)? Is it based on an <span class="eqn_il">1/<i>e</i><sup>2</sup></span> intensity criterion?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Output power stability: &plusmn;1&#37;&rdquo;: this is extremely vague: does it mean that the power always stays within &plusmn;1&#37; of the average value? What is the measurement time and bandwidth? (Typically, larger fluctuations are recorded with a fast detector used over a long time.) A root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) value with a well defined bandwidth (range of noise frequencies) should be given.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Optical bandwidth: 0.1&nbsp;nm&rdquo;: is this meant as a full width at half maximum? Is it an upper or lower limit for the bandwidth?
(Usually, it is the upper limit, but there are cases where a lower limit is required.)</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">If any parameter like the emission wavelength or pulse repetition rate can be varied, this raises the question how that setting affects other values such as the output power.</aside>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Tuning range: 1030&ndash;1080&nbsp;nm&rdquo;: does the laser just work in that range, or is the specified output power available over this whole range?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Linewidth: &lt;&thinsp;50&nbsp;kHz&rdquo;: what is the measurement time?
(Slow frequency drifts can lead to larger values for longer measurements times.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Timing jitter: &lt;&thinsp;100&nbsp;fs&rdquo; (for an <a href="ultrafast_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting ultrashort pulses">ultrafast laser</a>): is this a pulse-to-pulse jitter? (Probably not, that should be far lower.) What is the considered range of noise frequencies?</li>
</ul>
<p>Further problems or inconvenience can result from not common acronyms or units.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">How Strictly Should Specifications be Interpreted?</h2>
<div>
<p>Laser specifications are often not interpreted as strictly guaranteed values.
What level of strictness is applied, depends substantially on the field of application:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">If specifications do not explicitly state how strictly they should be understood, and what would be the consequence of a failure to adhere to them, judgments will have to depend on the circumstances, such as the area of application.</aside>
<ul>
<li>Quite strict interpretations are common in fields which generally exhibit a high degree of standardization, such as <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, <a href="optical_clocks.html" title="time measurement devices based on optical frequency standards">optical clocks</a> or <a href="medical_lasers.html" title="laser systems used for medical applications">medical lasers</a>.
Here, a high precision of specifications is particularly important, and not completely adhering to them is considered as serious.</li>
<li>For <a href="industrial_lasers.html" title="lasers used for industrial purposes, for example for laser material processing">industrial lasers</a>, a slightly lower degree of strictness is often applied, although a high degree of reliability in long-term operation may be quite important.</li>
<li>Rather lax interpretations occur in the context of consumer products, but also often for <a href="scientific_lasers.html" title="lasers which are designed for scientific applications">scientific lasers</a>.
In the latter case, it is often expected that the users are fairly familiar with the internal workings of a laser apparatus and can take over some tasks, such as occasional cleaning or realignment of a laser, or exchanging the laser medium of a <a href="dye_lasers.html" title="lasers based on liquid or solid dyes as gain media">dye laser</a>.
Relatively frequent interruptions of laser operation for unplanned service operations may be tolerated.
It is often accepted that optimum performance is possible only under ideal conditions, including e.g. frequent optimization of alignment.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">Deviations from specs are considered less serious for prototype lasers than for lasers to be used in production machines.</aside>
<p>Another aspect is whether a laser device is a prototype, a mass product or even a production machine.
A prototype nature may be assumed when a laser has been made to certain specifications for the first time and the user knows this; a laser may be ordered explicitly for evaluation purposes.
To a certain degree, deviations from specifications may not be considered as complete failures.
On the other hand, from a standard <a href="industrial_lasers.html" title="lasers used for industrial purposes, for example for laser material processing">industrial laser</a> for use as a production machine one has to expect a high reliability including to fairly strict adherence to specifications.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">A comprehensive measurement protocol can clearly document various tests and demonstrate adherence to specifications.</aside>
<p>In cases where adherence to specifications is crucial, a laser system will normally be delivered together with a comprehensive and clearly written measurement protocol, demonstrating that all relevant aspects have been checked on the concrete delivered device.
However, many manufacturers appear not to apply such systematic procedures, do not deliver such measurement protocols, and indeed might not check all aspects with measurements before deployment.
Deviations from specifications may then be noticed only after installation, or possible even at a later time when the user, having experienced certain problems, undertakes more detailed measurements.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">What Happens if Specifications are not Fulfilled?</h2>
<div>
<p>It is important to understand whether certain deviations from specifications are considered as complete failure of the system (implying a right for a complete replacement or for not paying the invoice) or only as a reason for repair by the manufacturer.
For some critical <a href="laser_applications.html" title="applications involving laser devices">laser applications</a>, the user can expect that the device is only delivered after careful checks by the manufacturer, and that it will with a high probability remain within specifications for the guaranteed lifetime &ndash; without additional checks and unplanned repairs.
In many cases, however, a manufacturer feels obliged only to do appropriate repairs upon discovery of problems by the user.
This may lead to situations where the application of the laser is severely disturbed by unplanned repairs and corresponding delays, possibly also by extended periods of operation outside the specs due to not recognized problems, and to resulting quality issues in the production.</p>
<p>For such reasons, it is important to create a common understanding between supplier and user <em>before purchase</em> according to how deviations from specifications are handled.
Note that even specifications with very precise definitions of measured parameters may totally leave open such important aspects.</p>

<h2>Trouble with Specifications</h2>
<p>Specifications for lasers and other photonics products are essential for the process of buying such things.
Nevertheless, many do not properly deal with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many product specifications by suppliers lack quality &ndash; they are incomplete, not sufficiently clear, etc.</li>
<li>Buyers are often not aware of what they really need. For example, they forget essential requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various problems can arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to a lack of clarity, tedious communications between supplier and buyer are required.</li>
<li>Product specifications raise expectations which cannot be met.</li>
<li>Conflicts can arise over such issues.</li>
</ul>
