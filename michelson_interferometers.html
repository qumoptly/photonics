<p>A Michelson interferometer, as invented by Albert Abraham Michelson in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, is a very common type of <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometer</a>, which is frequently used for measuring distances or their changes, but also in various other applications (see below).</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Interferometer Setup and Operation Principle</h2>
<div>
<p>Such an interferometer is usually operated with a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> as a quasi-<a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> light source, although this is not strictly required; the original invention by Michelson was done long before the first laser, and there are still important applications with other light sources, e.g. <a href="superluminescent_sources.html" title="optical sources based on superluminescence">superluminescent sources</a> in <a href="white_light_interferometers.html" title="interferometers using broadband light inputs">white light interferometers</a> of Michelson type.</p>
<p>It is advantageous to have a single transverse mode <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>, approximating a <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a>.
Typically, the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> is kept relatively small, but large enough to have a <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated beam</a> with roughly constant beam radius along the whole path.
For that, the <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> should be at least as large as the total path length involved. </p>
<figure>
<img src="img/michelson_interferometers.png" alt="Michelson interferometer">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Three versions of Michelson interferometers.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A Michelson interferometer (see Figure&nbsp;1) contains a single <a href="beam_splitters.html" title="devices for splitting a laser beam into two or more beams">beam splitter</a> for separating and recombining the beams.
There are two <em>interferometer arms</em> (each one extending from the beam splitter to an end mirror), which are completely separated in this design.
The beams are aligned such that the overlap of the two beams going towards the <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> is as good as possible.
Ideally, one has two beams with equal complex amplitude profiles (e.g. <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a> with equal <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a>), going along the same axis.
In that case, one does not observe a fringe pattern at the detector, but rather a beam having a profile with constant shape and only variable power.</p>
<p>The beam splitter can be a half-silvered mirror, for example, or a <a href="dielectric_mirrors.html" title="mirrors consisting of multiple thin layers of different transparent optical materials">dielectric mirror</a>.
Its <a href="reflectivity.html" title="the ratio of reflected optical power to the incident optical power at a surface">reflectivity</a> is normally chosen to be around 50&thinsp;&#37;.</p>
<p>In the simplest implementation with ordinary end <a href="mirrors.html" title="devices which reflect light">mirrors</a> (Figure&nbsp;1, top), each beam may exactly be reflected back in itself, which however may be problematic for the light source; many lasers are sensitive to optical feedback, which may e.g. destabilize their operation.</p>
<p>Therefore, one may introduce a slight tilt of the two end mirrors (Figure&nbsp;1, middle), such that the reflected beams meet on a slightly separate spot on the beam splitter, and feedback into the light source is avoided.
This also allows one to get access to both output beams without employing a <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolator</a>, for example.
Note, however, that perfect overlap of the two beams going towards the detector is possible only for instruments with equal arm lengths, and one somewhat loses beam overlap when simply translating an end mirror.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">By using retroflectors instead of ordinary mirrors, one can substantially reduced the alignment sensitivity.</aside>
<p>Another possibility is to use <a href="retroreflectors.html" title="optical devices which reflect light in a direction which is parallel to the incident beam">retroreflectors</a> (Figure&nbsp;1, bottom), where perfect alignment is possible for any arm lengths.
This also has the often essential advantage that the interferometer is fairly insensitive to slight angular misalignment of the retroreflectors, which essentially causes only a slight lateral shift but no change in beam direction.</p>
<p>If perfect alignment is not possible, i.e., some fringe pattern on the detector side is unavoidable (e.g. for large variations of arm lengths due to <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>), the active area of the photodetector should be so small that one detects only the center of the pattern, for example.
Otherwise, the interference signal would be washed out.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Output Signal</h2>
<div>
<p>The beam going to the detector has two contributions, one from each interferometer arm.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, which one often tries to realize in practice, both contributing beams have equal beam axes and equal complex amplitude profiles, apart from a possible difference in <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phase</a>.
Neglecting parasitic power losses at the beam splitter (with reflectivity <span class="eqn_il"><i>R</i></span>) and the end mirrors, we can first calculate the optical power getting to the detector when the beam path corresponding to the reflector at the top is blocked: it is <span class="eqn_il"><i>P</i><sub>laser</sub>&thinsp;&middot;&thinsp;(1&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;<i>R</i>)&thinsp;&middot;&thinsp;<i>R</i></span>, because the beam first has power losses due to transmission through the beam splitter and later upon reflection.
For the other arm, we obtain the same result, only we first have reflection and then transmission.
The corresponding complex amplitudes are proportional to the square roots of the powers.
The total power going to the detector is then, if we also assume <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> light:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/mi_p_det.gif" width="437" height="34" alt="output signal of Michelson interferometer"></div>
<p>where <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&delta;</span><span class="greek">&phi;</span></span> is the phase difference of the contributions from both arms.
For <span class="eqn_il"><i>R</i></span> = 0.5, we obtain</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/mi_p_det05.gif" width="146" height="41" alt="output signal of Michelson interferometer"></div>
<p>and see that we get between zero power and the full laser power going to the detector (i.e., perfect interference contrast), depending on the relative phase shift between the interferometer arms.
For <span class="eqn_il"><i>R</i></span> &ne; 0.5, the interference signals gets weaker, but this is not a critical parameter for the interference contrast.
Imperfect alignment of interferometer, however, can reduce the interference contrast.</p>
<p>It is normally assumed that the phase difference changes by <span class="eqn_il">2<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span> when the arm length difference changes by half a wavelength (note the double pass).
This is not exactly the case, however, since when does not have plane waves propagating in the instrument (see below).</p>
<aside class="callout green">What happens for operation with non-mono&shy;chro&shy;matic light?</aside>
<p>If the light source is not monochromatic, one will generally not be able to achieve perfect destructive or constructive interference.
A relatively simple calculation can be done for a light source with a Gaussian <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>, and the result is that the interference signal obtains an additional Gaussian factor, which reduces the interference contrast with increasing arm length difference.
The larger the bandwidth of the light source, the smaller needs to be the arm length difference to obtain a strong interference contrast.</p>
<p>Michelson originally used a broadband light source in the famous Michelson&ndash;Morley experiment, so that he had to build an interferometer with close to zero arm length difference.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Data Processing for Distance Measurements</h2>
<div>
<p>It is relatively simple to measure changes of an arm length if it is known in which direction that change occurs.
Essentially, one then only has to count the oscillations of the interference signal; each oscillation period corresponds to an arm length change of half the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>.
Of course, one can greatly improve the accuracy by not only counting the number of oscillation cycles, but computing accurate phase values; it is often possible that way to determine length changes with an accuracy which is of the order of 1&thinsp;/&thinsp;100 of the wavelength.</p>
<p>There are various ways for reliably determining arm length changes even if the direction of movement is not known in advance.
For example, one can operate an interferometer with two or more substantially different wavelengths, generating detector signals for each one in order to lift the data ambiguity.
Other methods are based on modulating the arm length difference or the laser frequency in order to retrieve additional information from the resulting modulated detector signal.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Using a Compensating Plate</h2>
<div>
<p>The optical setups as shown in Figure&nbsp;1 exhibit an asymmetry related to the beam splitter, which typically has a reflecting coating on one side.
For the upper arm, the light goes through the beam splitter plate once, while for the right arm there are two passages through the plate.
This asymmetry may cause problems due to the <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> of the plate, when a non-monochromatic light source is used.
It may be compensated by inserting into the upper arm a compensating plate of suitable thickness, made from the same material as the beam splitter <a href="mirror_substrates.html" title="substrates on which coatings for laser mirrors can be deposited">substrate</a>.
That also compensates the temperature dependence.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Factors Degrading the Accuracy of Distance Measurements</h2>
<div>
<p>Accurate distance measurements require a light source with an accurately stabilized optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> or <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">frequency</a>.
Therefore, one sometimes needs to use special techniques for the <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">stabilization of lasers</a>.</p>
<p>Interference signals are affected by changes of both arm lengths.
One often tries to keep the reference arm length as precisely constant as possible.
This can be achieved with a careful mechanical construction based on materials (e.g. certain glass ceramics) with a very low coefficient of thermal expansion.</p>
<p>Mechanical vibrations can also seriously affect the operation of such an interferometer.
Therefore, Michelson interferometers often need to be carefully shielded against vibrations, and constructed with a rigid base plate and robust <a href="opto_mechanics.html" title="mechanical elements used in optics">opto-mechanics</a>.
In Michelson's original experiment, the whole interferometer setup was floating in a trough of mercury.</p>
<p>The optical phase differences are not exactly as calculated for <a href="plane_waves.html" title="waves with plane wavefronts">plane waves</a>, since in reality one uses light beams with finite transverse extension.
For <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a>, for example, one has the additional <a href="gouy_phase_shift.html" title="an additional phase shift occurring in the propagation of focused Gaussian beams">Gouy phase shift</a>, which can be relevant for highly accurate measurements.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Examples for Applications of Michelson Interferometers</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Distance Measurements</h3>
<div>
<p>A typical application is the measurement of length changes with methods as explained above.
For example, one may precisely monitor the movement of machine parts.</p>
<p>Extremely high accuracies are required for the detection of gravitational waves e.g. in the LIGO experiment.
Here, interferometer arm lengths of several kilometers are used, and changes of those by tiny fractions of an atom diameter need to be detected.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Michelson Objectives for Profilometers</h3>
<div>
<p>Michelson objectives are essentially small Michelson interferometers realized within <a href="microscope_objectives.html" title="the optical component of a microscope which is next to the observed object">microscope objectives</a> and are used in some kinds of <a href="optical_profilometers.html" title="optical non-contact instruments for precisely measuring surface profiles">optical profilometers</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Optical Coherence Tomography</h3>
<div>
<p>Some Michelson interferometers are intentionally operated with a very broadband light source, so that an interference contrast occurs only near zero arm length difference, as explained above.
This is utilized in <a href="optical_coherence_tomography.html" title="an optical imaging technique where longitudinal resolution is achieved based on interference effects with low-coherence light">optical coherence tomography</a>, for example.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Spectral Measurements</h3>
<div>
<p>By recording the interference signal during a linear scan of an arm length, one can determine the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> of the light source.
This is the principle of a <a href="wavemeters.html" title="devices for precise measurements of laser wavelengths">wavemeter</a>.
For high accuracy, a second interference signal from a highly stabilized reference laser is often used.
The same basic principle can be utilized for <a href="fourier_transform_spectroscopy.html" title="a method for spectroscopy rare an optical spectrum is computed from raw data with a Fourier transform">Fourier transform spectrometers</a>, which can measure the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectra</a> (and thus the temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>) also of <a href="polychromatic_light.html" title="light with multiple optical frequencies">polychromatic</a> light sources.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Chromatic Dispersion Measurements</h3>
<div>
<p>The <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> of optical elements, such as <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a> or optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, can be measured with white light interferometers of Michelson type.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Tunable Optical Filters</h3>
<div>
<p>A Michelson interferometer can also be used as a tunable <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filter</a>, where the optical characteristics are adjusted through the arm length difference.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Scientific Applications</h3>
<div>
<p>The first application, done by Michelson himself, was a scientific one, essentially the search for evidence for the expected luminiferous aether as the medium in which light propagates.</p>
<p>Gravitational wave detection has already been mentioned above.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Similar Types of Interferometers</h2>
<div>
<p>There are many variations of the Michelson interferometer.
For example, a <a href="twyman_green_interferometers.html" title="an interferometer similar to a Michelson interferometer, but with expanded beams">Twyman&ndash;Green interferometer</a> is essentially a Michelson interferometer illuminated with a <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> point source.
It is used for characterizing optical elements.</p>
<p>Similar interferometers may also be made based on optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>.
Here, the beam splitter is a directional <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber coupler</a>.
While such a fiber-based interferometer can be quite stable against vibrations and immune against misalignment, it can be more sensitive to temperature changes.
Also, one needs to deal with problems related to random <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> of the fiber &ndash; for example, by using <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fibers</a>.</p>
