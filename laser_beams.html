<p>In most cases, a laser emits <a href="laser_light.html" title="light generated with a laser device">light</a> in the form of a well directed laser beam.
This means that the light dominantly propagates in a certain direction, typically with most of the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> concentrated to a small area of the order of a square millimeter.</p>
<p>Laser beams are often close to <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a>, where the transverse profile of the <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a> can be described with a Gaussian function, the width of which varies along the propagation direction.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/gaussian_beam.png" alt="Gaussian beam">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Snapshot of the electric field distribution around the focus of a <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a>. In this example, the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> is only slightly larger than the wavelength, and the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> is strong.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Generally, laser beams exhibit a high degree of spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>, which is related to a high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
As a result, one obtains good focusability and the potential to form <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated beams</a> with very low <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>.</p>
<p>When a laser beam hits some object (for example a workpiece in laser material processing), the arriving optical intensity is also called the <a href="irradiance.html" title="the radiant flux (optical power) received by a surface per unit area">irradiance</a>.</p>
<p>The propagation of <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a> can be calculated with a set of relatively simple equations.
In cases with non-ideal <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, one can use a generalized set of equations which also involves the so-called beam quality factor <a href="m2_factor.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup></a>.
In this case, the equations cannot predict the detailed evolution of beam profile, but only of the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> based on the second moment of the intensity profile (D4&sigma; method).</p>
<p><a href="laser_light.html" title="light generated with a laser device">Laser light</a> often have a small optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, so that the temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> is also high.
An often unwanted consequence of the high level of coherence is the tendency to form <a href="laser_speckle.html" title="light patterns resulting from the reflection of coherent light at rough surfaces">laser speckle</a> patterns.</p>
<p>The <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> of a laser beam may hardly change during propagation in a transparent medium, or quickly decay in an absorbing or <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattering</a> medium.
Inhomogeneous media (i.e., media with a locally varying <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>) can also distort the shapes of laser beams.
This can happen due to e.g. thermal effects such as <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> in a <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>.</p>
<p>Some lasers emit <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuously</a>, but a laser beam can also consist of a fast sequence of <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a>, with many millions or even billions of pulses per second (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser"><em>pulse repetition rate</em></a>).
The light distribution may then be described as a regular sequence of a kind of &ldquo;light bullets&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Laser light is often <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">linearly polarized</a>, i.e., the electric field oscillates in a certain direction perpendicular to the propagation direction.
Some lasers, however, emit light with an undefined, fluctuating polarization state.</p>
<aside class="callout green">Is a laser beam visible from the side?</aside>
<p>A laser beam of visible light with sufficiently high power may be visible when propagating in air.
This is because a tiny portion of the optical power is <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattered</a> by dust particles and/or density fluctuations in the air and can therefore reach the observing eye.
When the laser beam hits some diffusely scattering object, such as a white screen, a much brighter spot is seen on that screen, since most of the optical power is scattered at this point.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Near Field and Far Field of Laser Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>The <a href="near_field_and_far_field.html" title="the optical field either close to a source or object or far from it"><em>near field</em></a> is understood to be the region around the <a href="beam_waist.html" title="location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a> (focus).
The <a href="near_field_and_far_field.html" title="the optical field either close to a source or object or far from it"><em>far field</em></a> concerns the profile far from the waist, i.e., in a distance from the focus which is large compared with the effective <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a>.
The far field intensity profile reveals details of the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, which in the near field can be obtained only with <a href="wavefronts.html" title="surfaces connecting points with the same phase of a wave">wavefront</a> measurements.
As it is often not practical to access the far field directly, one may use a focusing <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> (or mirror) to obtain an intensity profile in its <a href="focal_points_and_focal_planes.html" title="points to which parallel input rays are concentrated by an optical system, and the planes going through those points">focal plane</a> which reveals a scaled-down version of the far field pattern.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Limitations for the Focusing of Laser Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>Laser beams can be used for transmitting optical energy to rather small spots or with low <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">divergence</a> over large distances.
However, there are limitations to this, which involve the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>, the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and the transverse size of the used focusing or <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimation</a> optics.
Some of these limitations are discussed in the following, always assuming propagation of the beam through a homogeneous medium (i.e., with no added beam distortions on the way).</p>
<p>If a laser beam is focused to a spot (<a href="beam_waist.html" title="location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a>) with <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>0</sub></span>, it exhibits a certain <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> angle which is inversely proportional to the waist beam radius and proportional to the optical wavelength in the <a href="m2_factor.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a>:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/theta_m2.gif" width="85" height="45" alt="beam divergence for non-ideal laser beam"></div>
<p>The used focusing optics must be able to handle that amount of divergence; a limitation for that results from the limited <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> of the optics.
Also, if the focus has to have a large distance from the focusing optics and/or the waist radius is small or the beam quality is low, the beam radius in the focusing optics will necessarily be quite large.
A correspondingly large open <a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">aperture</a> of the optics is required.
Such factors can in practice set a lower limit to the achievable radius in the focus, or an upper limit to the tolerable <a href="m2_factor.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, one optimizes the beam radius in the focus such that the radius at a certain distance from the focus is as small as possible.
For that purpose, one has to choose the waist beam radius such that the effective <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> equals the mentioned transmission distance.
The resulting radius at the distant position will then be &asymp;1.41 times the waist beam radius.</p>
<p>If the sent-out light does not have to have its focus at the focusing optics, one should place the focus in the middle between the optics and the distant point.
Ideally, the effective Rayleigh length will then be half the transmission distance.
The beam radius at the distance spot will be identical to that at the focusing optics, and &asymp;1.41 times larger than in the beam focus.</p>
<p>For example, if a Gaussian laser beam at 1064&nbsp;nm should be sent to the moon (distance 380&thinsp;000&nbsp;km) in order to illuminate a small spot there, the ideal radius in the focus will be 8&nbsp;m, such that the Rayleigh length is 190&thinsp;000&nbsp;km.
The radius in the focusing optics and on the moon will then be 11.3&nbsp;m.
If the used sending <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescope</a> cannot be that large, the illuminated spot on the moon will be larger.</p>
<p>When creating a beam focus in some distance from some focusing optics with a limited open aperture, the possible waist radius will increase if that distance is increased.
Furthermore, there is a maximum to that distance; in the extreme case, the distance equals the effective <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> of the beam, and the resulting waist beam radius will be smaller than the beam radius at the focusing optics by the square root of 2 (&asymp;1.41).
One can thus easily calculate the Rayleigh length based on the initial radius and thus the maximum focusing distance.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Experimental Characterization of Laser Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>There are various devices and techniques for characterizing a laser beam in various respects; see the article on <a href="laser_beam_characterization.html" title="methods of assessing detailed properties of laser beams">laser beam characterization</a>.</p>
<p>For many <a href="laser_applications.html" title="applications involving laser devices">laser applications</a>, it is essential to have proper means for beam diagnostics, as many possible problems can be identified with such instruments.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Switching of Laser Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>If a laser beam is unwanted at certain times &ndash; for example, for <a href="laser_safety.html" title="safety of the use of laser devices">safety</a> reasons &ndash;, one may in principle simply turn off the laser.
This is not always practical, however.
In some cases, one applies some kind of <a href="beam_shutters.html" title="devices for blocking or releasing light beams">beam shutter</a>, with which the beam can be blocked when necessary.
The switching can also be automated, e.g. to automatically lock a beam when a laser enclosure is opened.
For periodic switching, there are <a href="optical_choppers.html" title="devices for periodically interrupting light beams">optical choppers</a>.</p>
