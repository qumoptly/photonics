<p>Diffraction is a general term for phenomena which can occur when <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> <a href="wave_optics.html" title="the description of optical phenomena based on wave models">waves</a> (or other waves) encounters certain structures.
Some typical examples for diffraction effects are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p>Although in everyday life one rarely encounters substantial diffraction effects with light, such effects are very common in optics and laser technology.
In fact, the operation principles of various optical devices are essentially based on diffraction (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="diffractive_optics.html" title="optical elements with operation principles based on diffraction of light"><em>diffractive optics</em></a>).
Diffraction also plays a crucial role in many other devices, such as <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonators</a> and <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Diffraction at a Single Slit</h2>
<div>
<p>A common situation is that a narrow <a href="optical_slits.html" title="narrow openings through which light can be transmitted">optical slit</a> is uniformly illuminated with spatially coherent radiation from a <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> laser.
Behind the slit, one can observe a diffraction pattern (see Figure&nbsp;1) with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each wavelength, there is a main maximum in the middle, and they are much weaker side maxima at larger angles.</li>
<li>For longer wavelengths, the central peak is broader, and the side peaks appear at larger angles.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="img/diffraction_at_single_slit.png" alt="diffraction at single slit">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Far-field intensity profiles for diffraction at a single 1&nbsp;&mu;m wide optical slit, with wavelengths from 400&nbsp;nm to 750&nbsp;nm in steps of 50&nbsp;nm.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For a given wavelength, the first minimum of the intensity occurs where the phase difference of contributions from the two edges of the slit reaches <span class="eqn_il">2<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>.
The intensity profiles can be described with sinc<sup>2</sup> functions.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Diffraction at a Double Slit</h2>
<div>
<p>In his famous double-slit experiment of 1803, Thomas Young used two closely spaced narrow <a href="optical_slits.html" title="narrow openings through which light can be transmitted">optical slits</a>.
As he had no laser, he had to achieve spatially coherent illumination of the two slits by using a third narrow slit before them.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;2 shows a calculated intensity profile for one particular wavelength.
The first installation arises from the interference of field contributions from the two different slits.
The intensity profile is further slowly modulated with a function determined by the finite width of each slit.</p>

<p>Figure&nbsp;3 shows with a color scale the interference patterns for different wavelengths.
The patterns for longer wavelength involve correspondingly larger diffraction angles.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Diffraction at Circular Apertures</h2>
<div>
<p>If a light beam (for example a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>) encounters some <a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">aperture</a> which transmits the light in some regions and blocks it otherwise, the immediate effect on the transmitted light is only the corresponding truncation of the intensity profile.
Only after some distance behind the aperture, characteristic diffraction effects can be observed.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;4 shows a simulated example, where an originally <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a> has been truncated at a centered circular hard aperture.
During the further propagation in air, the intensity profile develops a complicated structure due to diffraction.
For a soft aperture (Figure&nbsp;5), causing a smooth intensity drop at the edge, the diffraction pattern is smoother.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/diffraction_at_aperture1.png" alt="diffraction at aperture">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
Intensity profiles of a light beam directly behind a hard circular aperture (blue curve) and at some distances behind the aperture in steps of 25&nbsp;mm. The simulation has been done with the software <a href="fiberpower.html">RP Fiber Power</a>.

</figure>
<figure>
<img src="img/diffraction_at_aperture2.png" alt="diffraction at aperture">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;5:</span> 
Same as Figure&nbsp;4, except that a soft aperture is used.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Such diffraction effects can be well understood and calculated based on <a href="fourier_optics.html" title="the description of light propagation based on transverse spatial Fourier transforms">Fourier optics</a>.
The hard aperture introduces high optical frequencies, corresponding to rapid spatial changes of intensity.</p>
<p>Such effects can also occur, for example, when trying to force a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> into single transverse mode operation (for optimum <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>) by inserting a hard aperture into the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.
Although such an aperture can provide substantially higher round-trip losses for higher-order resonator <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>, compared with those for the fundamental mode, it also introduces diffraction effects.
Therefore, the method often does not work that well.</p>
<p>The angular resolution of many optical instruments such as <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescopes</a> is also limited due to diffraction e.g. at the input <a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">aperture</a>.
That resolution limit can be estimated to be roughly the <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> divided by the aperture diameter.</p>
<p>Apertures are not always circular.
Figures&nbsp;6 and 7 show an example case, where a laser beam is truncated with a blade.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/diffraction_at_blade1.png" alt="diffraction at a blade">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;6:</span>

</figure>
<p>Most <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> and <a href="laser_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems used with lasers - either in lasers or for transmitting and manipulating laser light">laser optics</a> are designed such that there are only negligibly weak diffraction effects due to hard apertures.
This implies that all <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a>, for example, must be so large that essentially the whole beam profile can be reflected.</p>
<p>Note that the diffraction effects are intrinsically dependent on the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>.
For <a href="polychromatic_light.html" title="light with multiple optical frequencies">polychromatic</a> beams, the resulting spatial patterns can substantially differ between different wavelength components.
Therefore, it is possible that one observes colors for a white input beam, for example.
The classical case is that of a <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction grating</a>, which is discussed further below.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Divergence of Laser Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>Even without any aperture, a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> always exhibits some amount of diffraction according to its transverse spatial limitation.
For <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a>, the shape of the intensity profile is preserved, i.e., it stays Gaussian; only the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> gradually increases.
This property of preserved intensity profile shapes also applies for other kinds of free-space <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>, e.g. to <a href="hermite_gaussian_modes.html" title="propagation modes or resonator modes which are described with Hermite&ndash;Gaussian functions">Hermite&ndash;Gaussian modes</a>.
In general, however, diffraction leads to changes of the shape of the intensity profile, as can be seen e.g. in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>Laser beams are often <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a>, i.e., their expansion during propagation is not stronger than caused by diffraction alone.</p>
<p>Strong diffraction effects occur for light with long wavelengths.
For example, <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">difference frequency generation</a> of long-wavelength beams can be severely limited in performance by diffraction of the generated beam, which limits the interaction length or enforce weaker beam focusing.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Diffraction and Resonator or Waveguide Modes</h2>
<div>
<p>Diffraction effects also play a crucial role for the formation of certain kinds of <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>.
For example, there are modes of optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, for which (by definition) the intensity profile remains constant during propagation.
Such modes are formed by two counteracting effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diffraction alone would tend to widen a beam, as discussed above.</li>
<li class="ta_left"><a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">Waveguide</a> effects from a <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> profile of the fiber provide a kind of focusing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the fiber modes, these two effects exactly balance each other.
Similarly, <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> exhibit a balance of diffraction and focusing effects, only that the latter are usually lumped rather than distributed in the resonator.</p>
<p>Good stability of such modes is achieved when the two counteracting effects are relatively strong, so that any additional effects (e.g. imperfections of a fiber structure, bending of a fiber or misalignment of a resonator element) have comparatively weak effects.
Poor stability arises in situations where both effects are weak &ndash; for example, in a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> where the <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> of the beam is much larger than the resonator length.
Such situations can arise e.g. when developing <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a> with large <a href="mode_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extent of a laser mode or laser beam">mode radii</a> and short laser resonators.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Diffraction at Periodic and Non-periodic Structures</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:180px;">
<img src="img/grating.png" alt="beams at a diffraction grating">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;8:</span> 
Output beams of all possible diffraction orders at a diffraction grating.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Diffraction effects can also occur when a light beam encounters a structure which causes spatially periodic changes of the <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a> (via a variable <a href="absorbance.html" title="the logarithm with base 10 of the inverse transmittance">absorbance</a>) or of the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phase</a> (e.g. via a variable <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> or a height profile).
Such structures are called <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a>, and the phenomenon is called <em>Bragg diffraction</em>.
If a grating exhibits a large number of oscillations within the beam profile, there can be multiple diffracted output beams (see Figure&nbsp;8), each of which has a similar spatial shape as the input beam.
The beam direction of the output beams (except that of the zero-order beam) are dependent on the optical wavelength.
That effect is exploited e.g. in grating <a href="spectrometers.html" title="devices for separating spectral components">spectrometers</a>.</p>
<p>Diffraction can also be caused by refractive index modulations in some volume of a medium.
For example, there are <a href="volume_bragg_gratings.html" title="Bragg gratings written into some bulk material">volume Bragg gratings</a> which can be used as wavelength-dependent reflectors.
Also, Bragg diffraction is possible based on sound waves in a medium; this is exploited in <a href="acousto_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the acousto-optic effect">acousto-optic modulators</a>.</p>
<p>Diffraction effects can also occur in reflection.
In fact, most diffraction gratings are reflective elements.</p>
<p>Of course, diffraction effects also occur at non-periodic structures.
For example, the phenomenon of <a href="laser_speckle.html" title="light patterns resulting from the reflection of coherent light at rough surfaces">laser speckle</a> occurs when a laser beam is scattered on a rough surface, which in effect causes a complicated phase modulation pattern on the beam.
Very noticeable speckle effects can be observed with <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">quasi-monochromatic</a> light as obtained from lasers.
This is not the case for broadband (<a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">temporally incoherent</a>) light, because the obtained patterns have a strong wavelength dependence, such that the averaging of intensities over some wavelength range effectively washes out such patterns.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Diffractive Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>There are various other kinds of optical elements which exploit diffraction effects.
For example, there are diffractive <a href="beam_splitters.html" title="devices for splitting a laser beam into two or more beams">beam splitters</a> with multiple outputs, and similar devices are used for <a href="coherent_beam_combining.html" title="a class of methods for beam combining, requiring mutual coherence of the combined beams">coherent beam combining</a>.
For more details, see the article on <a href="diffractive_optics.html" title="optical elements with operation principles based on diffraction of light">diffractive optics</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Diffraction and Interference</h2>
<div>
<p>Diffraction effects can be explained based on the <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> of different contributions of a field profile to the resulting fields at distant locations (<em>Huygens&ndash;Fresnel principle</em>).
There is actually no clear boundary between diffraction and interference.
For example, the transmission of light through a narrow slit (aperture) is usually described in terms of diffraction, while phenomena behind a double slit are called interference phenomena.
However, the basic principle of interference can be applied to both cases.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Different Regimes of Diffraction</h2>
<div>
<p>Different regimes of diffraction are distinguished, which can be treated with different mathematical methods.
<em>Fraunhofer diffraction</em> is relevant when considering the <a href="near_field_and_far_field.html" title="the optical field either close to a source or object or far from it">far field</a>, i.e., diffraction patterns far away from the refracting structure; this regime is characterized by values of the <a href="fresnel_number.html" title="a parameter determining the regime of diffraction effects">Fresnel number</a> well below 1.
On the other hand, the concept of <em>Fresnel diffraction</em> with large Fresnel numbers can be applied to cases where the <a href="near_field_and_far_field.html" title="the optical field either close to a source or object or far from it">near field</a> is relevant.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Diffraction-limited Performance of Optical Instruments</h2>
<div>
<p>The performance of various kinds of optical instruments such as <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscopes</a> is essentially limited by diffraction effects.
Essentially, the limited transverse size of the entrance aperture or of internal elements cause diffraction effects which set a minimum spot size of the so-called point spread function.
Therefore, optical microscopes (including <a href="laser_microscopy.html" title="a technique for generating microscopic images by scanning objects with a laser">laser microscopes</a>) are usually limited in resolution to the order of half the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>.
There are few exceptions to that limitation, for example near field microscopes (using an optical tip of sub-wavelength size for scanning objects) or certain kinds of <a href="fluorescence_microscopy.html" title="a technique for acquiring microscopic images using fluorescence which is excited in the sample">fluorescence microscopy</a> (STED).</p>
<p>Similar performance limitations apply to optical <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescopes</a>.
Limiting diffraction effects (for optimum angular resolution) requires the use of large optical apertures.</p>

<h2>Short-term Software Licenses Available</h2>
<p>Do you need simulation software (such as our <a href="./fiberpower.html?banner=rented_software">RP Fiber Power</a>) only during a <b>short-term project</b>?</p>
<p>Or do you want to <b>test such software very thoroughly</b> before fully committing to it?</p>
<p>RP Photonics is now offering a solution: <a href="./software_licenses.html?banner=rented_software">software licenses</a> which are valid for a <b>limited time</b>.</p>
<p>Our conditions are very fair:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay only 5% of the amount for a permanent license for one month.</li>
<li>When switching over to a permanent license directly thereafter, get the already paid money fully deducted!</li>
<li>If you decide for that only later on, still get two thirds deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are confident that you will like our software and finally decide for permanent licenses.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:20px;">Stand up for Science!</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">It is acceptable that some don't know much about photons, biological evolution or global warming.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">But we don't want bigot ignorants to make political decisions and educate our children!</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">For example, <b>global warming</b> is not a matter of political opinion, but a fact. Ruthless profiteers are leading astray millions of uneducated people, seducing them to take utterly irresponsible positions. <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">But we cannot risk catastrophic climate changes!</span> Science tells us it is high time to act. Read, for example, the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/">IPCC Synthesis Report</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold;">Stand up for science (perhaps by joining a <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/">March for Science</a>) &ndash; it's our future!</p>
