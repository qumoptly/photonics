<p>A pump chamber is an assembly around the laser rod (or <a href="slab_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers where the gain medium has the form of a slab">slab</a>) within the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> of a <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">lamp-pumped laser</a> or within a laser <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a> setup.
Besides the laser rod, it typically contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are one or more lamps &ndash; <a href="flash_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps which are used for generating intense light pulses">flash lamps</a> in case of pulse lasers or <a href="arc_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps based on an electrical arc, or continuously operating gas discharge lamps">arc lamps</a> for <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a>.
The pump chamber contains electrical connections for the high voltage required to drive the lamps.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="right" style="width:177px;">
<img src="img/lamp_pumping.png" alt="lamp-pumped rod">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Lamp-pumped laser rod in a water-cooled pump chamber with reflective walls.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>One or more reflecting surfaces are used to direct much of the generated pump light into the laser rod.
An often used configuration of single-lamp chambers contains a reflector with elliptical cross section, where the laser rod and the lamp are each placed around one of the <a href="focal_points_and_focal_planes.html" title="points to which parallel input rays are concentrated by an optical system, and the planes going through those points">focal points</a> (see Figure&nbsp;1).
(When two lamps are used, the reflector cross section may be composed of two partial ellipses.)</li>
<li>The laser rod may be placed inside a filter glass tube which absorbs and thus attenuates spectral components of the light which may be detrimental for the laser rod.
The glass tube may also shield the laser crystal against the cooling water, i.e., act as a <em>flow tube</em>.</li>
<li>There is usually a cooling arrangement, which is often based on cooling water.
The housing of the pump chamber (made e.g. of anodized aluminum or stainless steel) has fittings for the water inlet and outlet, or sometimes multiple such fittings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of a <a href="slab_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers where the gain medium has the form of a slab">slab laser</a>, one often uses one lamp of each side of the slab.
instead of a filter tube, one can use flat filter windows between the slab and the lamps.</p>
<p>For essentially all lamp-pumped lasers, the technique of <a href="side_pumping.html" title="a technique of pumping a solid-state laser in directions which are approximately transverse to its beam direction">side pumping</a> is used, since the diffuse nature of the lamp emission is not suitable for <a href="end_pumping.html" title="a technique of optically pumping a laser medium in a direction along the laser beam">end pumping</a>.</p>
<p>For a simple laser, the pump chamber needs to be supplemented only with two <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a> for forming a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.
Additional optical components may be placed within the laser resonator &ndash; for example, additional mirrors, a <a href="brewster_plates.html" title="coplanar plates inserted into beams at Brewster's angle">Brewster plate</a> for enforcing linear <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html">polarization</a>, and a <a href="q_switches.html" title="optical switches which are typically used for generating nanosecond pulses in lasers">Q switch</a> for short pulse operation.</p>
<p>There are also laser pump modules containing <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> instead of lamps; those are usually not called laser pump chambers, since they do not require a reflecting chamber for directing the pump light.
However, the term sometimes appears in the context of <a href="slab_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers where the gain medium has the form of a slab">slab lasers</a> and <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a>, where multiple pump reflections are used.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Further Details of Laser Pump Chambers</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Laser Gain Media</h3>
<div>
<p>Different laser media are used in laser pump chambers.
A common choice is <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG</a>, typically for emission at 1064&nbsp;nm, but one also various other types of <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> for obtaining other output wavelengths (e.g. Nd:YLF for 1047&nbsp;nm, Er:YAG for 1.6&nbsp;&mu;m or 2.94&nbsp;&mu;m or Ho:YAG for 2.1&nbsp;&mu;m) and erbium- or neodymium-doped glass rods for broadband high energy amplifiers.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Rod Dimensions and Doping Concentration</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout red">Efficient pump absorption is only one of several aspects to be considered!</aside>
<p>A thicker and/or more highly <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doped</a> laser rod can of course more efficiently absorb the pump radiation.
On the other hand, efficient energy extraction combined with high laser <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> is tentatively more difficult with thicker rods, and high doping concentrations increase the tendency for power losses through <a href="upconversion.html" title="a process where light can be emitted with photon energies higher than those of the light generating the excitation">upconversion</a> phenomena, particularly in pulsed lasers.
The optimum choice of rod diameter results from a compromise between different aspects which depends on the detailed circumstances.
Typically, rods with diameters of the order of 5 to 10&nbsp;mm and moderate doping concentration are used.</p>
<p>Long pump chambers for the use of correspondingly long rods and lamps are suitable for higher laser powers or energies.
However, challenges related to <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, for example, are getting stronger at high power levels.
Typically, the rod length is between 50 and 200&nbsp;mm.</p>
<p>Pump chambers often allow the use of rods which are somewhat longer than the required minimum length.
The outer parts of the laser rod may then remain unpumped, which however does not significantly reduce the laser efficiency in case of a <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">four-level laser medium</a> such as Nd:YAG, because those do not exhibit reabsorption of laser light.
The advantages of using a somewhat longer rod can be that it is easier to insert, and that there is some reserve for later shortening e.g. if a damaged end face needs to be polished again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Designs with Multiple Lamps or Rods</h3>
<div>
<p>The use of multiple lamps in a pump chamber allows not only the generation of higher pulse energies, but can also lead to a more symmetric distribution of pump light.
Therefore, dual-lamp designs with lamps on opposite sides of the rod are common.</p>
<p>In some cases, a pump chamber contains multiple laser rods.
(The laser light may subsequently be sent through different rods.)
Using multi-rod chambers can provide increased output power combined with an increased conversion efficiency, since the absorption efficiency can be enhanced.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Materials for Reflectors</h3>
<div>
<p>Different materials can be used for pump light reflectors.
Metals like gold and silver (used as thin coatings, e.g. gold on brass or silver on nickel-plated aluminum) provide high reflectivities over wide spectral ranges.
The <a href="specular_reflection.html" title="reflection of light where the angle of reflected light equals the angle of incident light, but on the opposite side of the surface normal"><em>specular reflection</em></a> of metal surfaces makes it necessary to optimize the geometry for good power transfer efficiency and sufficient uniformity of the pump intensity.
(Non-uniform pump profiles can lead to increased problems e.g. with <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> and concerning <a href="beam_pointing_fluctuations.html" title="fluctuations of the propagation direction of a laser beam">beam pointing fluctuations</a>.)</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Diffuse reflectors (actually light scatterers) are tentatively less efficient, but more robust and more flexible in terms of chamber design.</aside>
<p>There are also materials providing <em>diffuse scattering</em> rather than specular reflection, for example white ceramics, certain polymer materials or a packed powder (e.g. barium sulfate).
Diffuse <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattering</a> can provide a more uniform pump intensity distribution in the rod, but is tentatively less efficient in terms of power transfer, because it may take multiple scattering events for light to get to the laser rod.
On the other hand, ceramic diffuse reflectors are quite durable, while metallic surfaces may tarnish over the time (particularly when exposed to cooling water, which may not be perfectly clean) and may then have to be repolished.</p>
<p>Particularly when using a laser rod with low absorption (e.g. due to a small diameter), low absorption of the scattering materials is important for a high power conversion efficiency.
The geometric shape of the reflecting (actually scattering) surface is less important; one can use, for example, a ceramic with cuboid or oval shape of the cavity containing rod and lamps.
Often, one uses close-coupled configurations, i.e., with a small distance between lamp and laser rod.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Filter Glass</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Details of the filter glass can significantly affect the laser performance.</aside>
<p>As mentioned above, the filter glass tube may be used for protecting the laser rod against detrimental spectral components of the lamp light.
Particularly, <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> is often removed which could cause crystal defects and thus a degrading optical transparency (<em>solarization</em>).
Also, some spectral components are not useful for the laser process and only lead to additional heating of the rod, so that their removal in the filter glass can be beneficial.
In some cases, the absorbed light is even converted to <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescent</a> light at longer wavelengths which is useful for the laser process.
For Nd:YAG lasers, silicate filter glasses doped with cerium (Ce) and samarium (Sm) are common.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Water Flow</h3>
<div>
<p>The flow of the coolant (typically water) must obviously be sufficient to remove the excess heat while avoiding excessive temperatures.
It can also be advantageous to optimize the coolant flow such that the temperature profile around the laser rod is quite uniform, so that <a href="astigmatism.html" title="a kind of optical aberrations; alternatively, a defect of optical lenses or a property of laser beams">astigmatic</a> <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> and problems with <a href="beam_pointing_fluctuations.html" title="fluctuations of the propagation direction of a laser beam">beam pointing fluctuations</a> are minimized.</p>
<p>Most pump chambers are so-called <em>wet chambers</em>, where the lamp(s) and rod(s) are in direct contact with the cooling water.
However, there are also <em>dry</em> designs, where those parts are separated from the cooling water, usually by glass tubes (flow tubes).
The latter approach may have practical advantages, but particularly the cooling of the laser rod is then less effective.</p>
<p>Depending on details of the construction (e.g. used materials), there may be different requirements on the purity of the cooling water.
Operating a pump chamber outside such specifications for longer while may lead to serious degradation or defects, e.g. due to corrosion.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the quality of the construction of a pump chamber is the safe avoidance of cooling water leaks, which otherwise could lead to electrical problems (even hazards) and/or the contamination of optical surfaces.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">OEM Pump Chambers</h3>
<div>
<p>Pump chambers may be sold with or without the corresponding laser rod and lamps.
They are often used as OEM parts, so that a manufacturer can produce lamp-pumped lasers without fabricating pump chambers himself.</p>

<h2>Your Lab is Closed due to the Corona Virus Crisis?</h2>
<p>Time to think how to best utilize your time!</p>
<p>Here is a suggestion: <br> <b>Consider to start with physical modeling!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Build models for your existing or planned lasers and amplifiers, resonators, etc.</li>
<li>Utilize such models in order to <b>improve your qualitative and quantitative understanding</b>, solve problems, optimize device performance and <b>develop new ideas</b>.</li>
<li>Power up your home office instead of wasting your time!</li>
<li>When getting back to the lab, restart with fresh plans and full power.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Free Tutorial: Modeling of Fiber Amplifiers and Lasers</h2>
<p>We have published a new <a href="./tutorial_modeling.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">tutorial</a> which discusses the modeling of fiber amplifiers and lasers.
It addresses many questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a <a href="./tutorial_modeling1.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">model</a>?</li>
<li>Should one use <a href="./tutorial_modeling3.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">power propagation or field propagation</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate the behavior of <a href="./tutorial_modeling4.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">laser-active ions</a>?</li>
<li>How to calculate <a href="./tutorial_modeling5.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">steady-state solutions</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate <a href="./tutorial_modeling6.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">dynamical behavior</a> and <a href="./tutorial_modeling7.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">ultrashort pulse propagation</a>?</li>
<li>What aspects are important for the <a href="./tutorial_modeling8.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">decision</a> whether to develop own modeling software or use commercial software?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./tutorial_modeling.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">Read the tutorial!</a></p>
