<p>Abstract: A discussion of the role of diffraction in optical fibers, particular in single-mode large mode area fibers, improves the understanding of how such devices work, and illuminates a technological area of intense current interest. An apparently fundamental limit of fibers, related to the too weak effect of diffraction at large mode areas, acts as a road block on the way toward output powers of tens or hundreds of kilowatts from a single fiber.</p>

<p>After treating the <a href="spotlight_2006_11_28.html">role of diffraction in optical resonators</a> in the previous article, I want to discuss how <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> acts in optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, again bringing up some useful thoughts for a better understanding of how these devices work, and at the same time illuminating a research area of great technological importance.</p>
<p>In a conventional <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>, the guided light is confined to a circular area with a diameter of the order of 10&nbsp;&mu;m, which roughly corresponds to the diameter of the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>.
In free space, such strong confinement would lead to a large <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">divergence angle</a>, but in a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> such as a fiber the spatially varying <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> has a focusing effect which exactly balances diffraction for certain field distributions, called the fiber <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>.
In a single-mode fiber, the waveguide effect is just strong enough to balance diffraction only for a single mode, but not for any more complicated field distributions.
As divergence would obviously be stronger for such complicated field distributions, we should not be surprised that the (single) fiber mode has a simple shape.</p>
<p>As diffraction becomes stronger for smaller modes, fibers with small mode areas require a larger <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> (NA) for proper guiding, while <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a> require a small NA if the guidance of <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes">higher-order modes</a> is to be prevented.
It thus becomes clear that single-mode fibers with large mode area are based on the balance of two weak effects: weak diffraction, and correspondingly a weak guiding effect from the waveguide structure.
Therefore, it is a quite basic (and hardly avoidable) consequence that any additional effects, such as those from bending the fiber (including unwanted microbends), can have a strong impact, e.g. in the form of <a href="bend_losses.html" title="propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">bend losses</a>.
This is not just a caveat of a particular design, but rather a fundamental problem of all known fiber types, including <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>, even though the exact limits of strictly single-mode guidance vary a little depending on the chosen type of fiber design.</p>
<p>For stable single-mode guidance with very large mode areas, we would have to arrange a balance of two strong effects &ndash; stronger than diffraction is in this regime.
And more than that: the balance should be so that it works only for a single (fundamental) mode.
Diffraction nicely contributes this mode discrimination, as it becomes stronger for smaller modes, but for just this reason it becomes ineffective at large mode areas.
Stronger diffraction for a large mode could in principle be achieved for a more complicated mode shape, but it is not clear how to arrange this in a regime of single-mode guidance: how then to prevent the simultaneous guidance for a smaller mode with simpler shape?
On the other hand, a proper substitute for the effect of diffraction appears not to be known.</p>
<p>At least it doesn't appear to be clear that a clever invention, leading to single-mode fiber designs with extremely large mode areas, cannot exist in principle.
I suppose that within the next few years we will either see a proof that such designs are impossible, or such designs themselves.
In the latter case, the essential road block for the development of <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high power fiber lasers and amplifiers</a> with single-mode output at tens or hundreds of kilowatts will be removed, and such fiber devices can again be considered as <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power-scalable</a>, even in that regime.
Already known approaches based on multimode fibers with high losses for higher-order modes cannot be considered to do this job, since they all don't allow for strongly increased mode areas, but only to slightly push the experienced limit.</p>
<p>P.S. In the case that such an invention or proof will be made by someone being inspired by this article, I would appreciate an acknowledgment, and (in the case of the invention) to obtain 0.1&#37; of the generated revenue!</p>
