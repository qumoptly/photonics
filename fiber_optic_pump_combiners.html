<p>High-power fiber amplifiers and lasers are based on <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth doped</a> <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a>.
In principle, one can inject pump and signal light into such a fiber simply by appropriately focusing the light, coming from here, onto a bare fiber end.
This is in fact often done for amplifier and laser devices in the research stage.
<a href="industrial_lasers.html" title="lasers used for industrial purposes, for example for laser material processing">Industrial lasers</a>, however, should be based on an all-fiber setup, where <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled</a> pump <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> are directly connected to the <a href="active_fibers.html" title="optical fibers containing laser-active dopants in the fiber core">active fiber</a> via some passive transport fibers, avoiding any air spaces in the beam path.
Besides those simple transport fibers (which are usually <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>), one then requires <em>fiber-optic pump combiners</em> (or <em>pump couplers</em>), i.e., special types of <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a> used for interfacing to the active fiber.
That approach allows for substantially better robustness and stability of the devices.</p>
<p>In the following, we consider not only pure pump combiners, but also signal&ndash;pump combiners, having an additional signal input.</p>
<p>Typically, such a device has the following interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>On one side, there is a fiber which can directly be connected (usually by <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicing</a>) to a certain type of active fiber.
(Between those two fibers, there is sometimes an additional <a href="passive_fibers.html" title="optical fibers without laser-active dopants in the fiber core">passive fiber</a>, e.g. in order to include a <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg grating</a> if that cannot be written into the active fiber.)</li>
<li>On the other side, the combiner has several input <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a> which can be connected to <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled</a> pump <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> (normally based either on <a href="broad_area_laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes with a strongly asymmetric shape of the emitting region">broad-area laser diodes</a> or <a href="diode_bars.html" title="a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a>).
In addition, there is often (but not always) another fiber (a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a> or a <a href="few_mode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting only few guided modes">few-mode fiber</a>) through which one may inject or extract signal light.
(In case of a <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a>, no signal light needs to be injected, but laser light needs to be extracted from one end.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a device may be placed in a metallic housing, which is typically a couple of centimeters long.
It may have to be put in thermal contact with a base plate in order to avoid excessive heating due to dissipated power.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">There are <span class="eqn_il">(<i>N</i>&thinsp;+&thinsp;1)&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;1</span> pump&ndash;signal combiners and <span class="eqn_il"><i>N&thinsp;&times;</i>&thinsp;1</span> pump combiners.</aside>
<p>A pump&ndash;signal combiner with six pump inputs and one signal input may be denoted as a <span class="eqn_il">(6&thinsp;+&thinsp;1)&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;1</span> combiner (or <span class="eqn_il">(6&thinsp;+&thinsp;1)&thinsp;:&thinsp;1</span> combiner).
There are also variants like <span class="eqn_il">(<i>N</i>&thinsp;+&thinsp;1)&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;1</span> with other values of <span class="eqn_il"><i>N</i></span>.
Pump combiners without a signal input are denoted as <span class="eqn_il"><i>N&thinsp;&times;</i>&thinsp;1</span> (or <span class="eqn_il"><i>N</i>&thinsp;:&thinsp;1</span>), where <span class="eqn_il"><i>N</i></span> may e.g. be 3, 7 or 19 &ndash; often an odd value, since an even number of fibers is arranged one central fiber.</p>
<p>It should in principle not be a problem not to use all pump input ports, except that of course one will lose pump brightness.</p>
<p>Besides industrial high-power lasers, pump&ndash;signal combiners are also used for <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a> (EDFAs) in the area of <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, e.g. for cable TV power amplifiers.
Low-power EDFAs work with simple dichroic <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a> based on single-mode fibers, but higher-power versions based on <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a> (including versions for <a href="few_mode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting only few guided modes">few-mode fibers</a> and <a href="multi_core_fibers.html" title="optical fibers containing more than one fiber core">multi-core fibers</a>) require multimode pump&ndash;signal combiners.</p>
<p>Similar pump combiners can also be used for <a href="direct_diode_lasers.html" title="diode lasers which are directly used e.g. for material processing">direct-diode</a> applications.
In that case, the output fiber can be a single-clad <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fiber</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Operation Principle of Pump Combiners</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:300px;">
<img src="img/pump_coupler1.png" alt="cross section of pump combiner fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Transverse cross section of the output of a pump combiner. The red area in the center corresponds to the fiber core, the six orange areas to the pump fibers. The green circle indicates the size of the pump cladding of the active fiber.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The typically used operation principle of a pump combiner with several inputs is that several (for example 6) pump fibers are arranged around a signal fiber (see Figure&nbsp;2) (or alternatively around another pump fiber), and that whole bundle (usually surrounded by a glass tube) is <a href="tapered_fibers.html" title="optical fibers which are over some length stretched out to a very small diameter">tapered down</a> such that its dimensions fit to those of the active fiber.
During the fabrication process of such a tapered combiner, all the fibers are fused together to form a stable rigid device.
The pump fibers may be mounted at a slight angle to the axis of the active fiber, so that their bending can be reduced and the pump light tentatively propagates towards the active <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> of the pump light as delivered to the active fiber must stay within the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> of that fiber, so that the pump light stays guided in the <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">cladding</a>.
Note that tapering of the pump fibers does not only reduce their beam areas, but at the same time increases the divergence of the guided light; that aspect needs to be taken into account in the combiner design.</p>
<p>Many <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a> have a pump cladding with the standard diameter of 125&nbsp;&mu;m; therefore, various pump combiners are available which are compatible with that dimension.
However, there are also active fibers with a smaller pump cladding, which is beneficial for obtaining higher <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> and therefore allows one to use shorter pieces of active fiber.
Besides, the diameters of the fibers can be increased e.g. to 200&nbsp;&mu;m or 250&nbsp;&mu;m for even higher power levels and reduced requirements on the <a href="radiance.html" title="the optical power per unit area and solid angle">radiance</a> (<a href="brightness.html" title="a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: often used instead of radiance or luminance">brightness</a>) of the pump radiation, although that reduces the effective pump absorption and makes the fibers more sensitive to bending.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;2 shows a typical high-power laser setup, containing two such fiber pump combiners.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/hp_fiber_laser.png" alt="all-fiber setup of high-power fiber laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Set up of a high-power fiber laser. Light from eight fiber-coupled pump diodes is combined with two pump fiber combiners and sent into the active fiber from both directions. Fiber Bragg gratings are used to form the laser resonator.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even if the pump radiation is entirely injected into the pump cladding only, it will eventually propagate such that its intensity profile requires a certain overlap with the doped <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, where pump light can be absorbed.
With numerical simulations based on numerical beam propagation, one can investigate in detail e.g. how design details of the combiner affect the pump absorption in the active fiber.</p>
<p>Pump combiners may have additional built-in features such as an air cladding (as in some <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>) for safely suppressing any pump leakage to the outside parts.
This supports reliable coupling without fiber damage (see below).</p>
<p>There are also pump combiners based on completely different operation principles.
For example, some of them use passive pump fibers which are wound around a central fiber, into which the pump radiation eventually couples.
This approach can be called <em>side pumping</em> (instead of <em>end pumping</em>), and one may have a continuous non-tapered fiber for the signal through the whole combiner.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Single-mode and Polarization-maintaining Combiners</h2>
<div>
<p>The term <em>single-mode combiners</em> is used for pump combiners where the <em>signal</em> input is delivered through a single-mode fiber, but usually not the pump inputs, which are generally multimode.</p>
<p>Similarly, polarization-maintaining combiners have <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining</a> properties only for the signal.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Important Properties of Pump and Signal Combiners</h2>
<div>
<p>The following properties of pump combiners are most relevant for typical applications in a <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber laser or amplifier</a>, once one has decided for a certain active fiber:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fiber diameters should be identical, mostly in order to allow for high-quality <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicing</a> with a precise matching of the core positions.</li>
<li>The pump fibers must be fully compatible with the fibers of the pump laser diodes.
The core diameter and <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> need to be at least as high as those of the pigtails of the pump diodes.
Larger values of the pump input fibers of the combiner are in principle no problem concerning power coupling efficiency, but inevitably mean that the full pump brightness will not be utilized.
In other words, the pump diodes then have a higher brightness than would be required.</li>
<li>For pump&ndash;signal combiners, the intensity profile of the fundamental signal fiber mode should be similar to that of the fundamental mode of the core of the active fiber, so that in an amplifier one can efficiently couple signal light into that fundamental mode.
For a fiber laser, this property is also useful, is it allows one to extract the laser radiation with optimal <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.</li>
<li>The pump light should propagate through the combiner with minimum losses (high coupling efficiency, often far above 90&#37;) &ndash; not only for obtaining a high power efficiency, but also for avoiding thermal damage.
Further, the pump light should be entirely launched into the pump cladding of the active fiber &ndash; not into its outer cladding, since otherwise one may destroy its coating.</li>
<li>In many cases, there should ideally only be a moderate loss of <a href="brightness.html" title="a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: often used instead of radiance or luminance">brightness</a> (radiance).
In other words, the brightness of pump radiation in the active fiber is not much lower than that of the pump diodes.</li>
<li>The combiner should of course safely withstand the intended optical power levels.</li>
<li>The devices are made for certain wavelength regions.
However, it is normally not critical e.g. whether a pump&ndash;signal combiner is used for signals at 1030&nbsp;nm or 1100&nbsp;nm.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, the rotational orientation of the combiner and active fiber needs to be optimized when splicing them together.
For example, there are active fibers where the pump cladding does not have a circular shape but rather six lobes which fit well to the cores of six pump fibers.
Another case is where <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fibers</a> are used. </p>
<p>In cases where it is essential to reduce the length of the active fiber as much as possible, it is desirable to have an active fiber with small pump cladding and a suitable pump combiner, but it is often difficult to procure such components.</p>
<p>As such devices have a substantial number of essential parameters, one cannot expect to find a suitable on-stock device for every application.
Custom pump combiners are therefore offered by some manufacturers.
(See also our general comments on <a href="custom_optics.html" title="optical elements made according to customer-specific specifications">custom optics</a>.)</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Estimating the Loss of Brightness</h2>
<div>
<p>In the following, it is explained how to check from the device specifications to which extent <a href="brightness.html" title="a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: often used instead of radiance or luminance">brightness</a> (radiance) is lost in a pump combiner.
We consider a combiner with <span class="eqn_il"><i>N</i></span> multimode (<a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index</a>) pump input fibers where the core diameter <span class="eqn_il"><i>d</i></span> and <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> NA is specified for the input fibers and the output fibers, and the power throughput is <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&eta;</span><sub>P</sub></span>.
The following formula can be used to estimate the degree to which the brightness is maintained:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/eta_brightness.gif" width="168" height="54" alt="brightness factor for pump couplers"></div>
<p>If the obtained value is close to 1, the brightness is essentially conserved, but some pump combiners have a value far below 1, indicating a substantial loss of brightness.
Other (commercially available) devices at least reach values of the order of 0.5.</p>
<p>Values above 1 are physically not possible.
(There are <a href="brightness_converters.html" title="optically pumped devices where the generated optical output has a higher brightness than the optical pump source">brightness converters</a> which can do that, but not with passive optics only.)</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Avoiding Damage During Operation</h2>
<div>
<p>For combiners working very high optical power levels (sometimes above several kilowatts), it is essential that no significant amount of pump light can leak out and e.g. get to any polymer coatings or claddings, which could easily be burned.
It may be necessary to use an additional <a href="cladding_mode_strippers.html" title="devices which can remove light from a fiber cladding">cladding mode stripper</a> to remove any light which propagates outside the core and pump cladding.
When using such devices, one should also carefully observe the instructions of use given by the manufacturer, as a combiner and/or the active fiber may otherwise easily be destroyed.</p>

They are based on precise fusion of multimode fibers techniques. For pumping of complex fiber amplifier designs, we have developed a signal feedthrough fiber at the center of the multimode fiber bundle, which is both single mode and polarization maintaining. We manufacture N &times; 1 multimode combiners as well as N + 1 &times; 1 combiners with a signal feedthrough fiber. Standard components are 3 &times; 1, 7 &times; 1, 2 + 1 &times; 1 and 6 + 1 &times; 1. All variants are available with custom pump, signal and output fibers.</p></aside>
