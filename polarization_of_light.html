</header>
<p>In many respects, light can be described as a wave phenomenon (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="wave_optics.html" title="the description of optical phenomena based on wave models"><em>wave optics</em></a>).
More specifically, light waves are recognized as electromagnetic <em>transverse waves</em>, i.e., with transverse oscillations of the electric and magnetic field.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Linear Polarization</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">The direction of polarization is associated with the electrical oscillations, not the magnetic ones.</aside>
<p>In the simplest case, a light beam is <em>linearly polarized</em>, which means that the electric field oscillates in a certain linear direction perpendicular to the beam axis, and the magnetic field oscillates in a direction which is perpendicular both to the propagation axis and the electric field direction.
The <em>direction of polarization</em> is taken to be the direction of the electric field oscillations (i.e., not the magnetic ones).
For example, a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> propagating in <span class="eqn_il"><i>z</i></span> direction may have the electric field oscillations in the vertical (<span class="eqn_il"><i>y</i></span>) direction and the magnetic field oscillations in the horizontal (<span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span>) direction (see Figure&nbsp;1); it can be called vertically polarized or <span class="eqn_il"><i>y</i></span>-polarized.
In a different perspective, this is also shown in the second part of Figure&nbsp;2.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/electromagnetic_wave.png" alt="electromagnetic wave">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
An electromagnetic wave traveling from left to right. The electric field (red) oscillates in the vertical direction and the magnetic field (blue) in a direction perpendicular to the drawing plane.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, the polarization can have any other direction perpendicular to the beam axis.
Note that a rotation of the polarization by 180&deg; does not lead to a physically distinct state.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Circular and Elliptical Polarization</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:280px;">
<img src="img/polarization.png" alt="polarization states">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Different polarization states of laser emission, illustrated for a few-cycle <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">pulse</a> propagating from left to right.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A circular polarization state can mathematically be obtained as a superposition of electric field oscillations in the vertical and horizontal direction, both with equal strength but a relative phase change of 90&deg;.
Effectively, this leads to a rapid rotation of the electric field vector &ndash; once per optical cycle &ndash; which maintains a constant magnitude.</p>
<p>One distinguishes left and right circular polarization (see Figure&nbsp;2).
For example, left circular polarization means that the electric (and magnetic) field vector rotates in the left direction, seen in the direction of propagation.
For an observer looking against the beam, the rotation of course has the opposite direction.</p>
<p>If the oscillations of the horizontal and vertical electric field vector do not have the same strengths, one has the case of an <em>elliptical polarization</em>, where the electric field vector, projected to a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction, moves along an ellipse.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Effects of Waveplates</h2>
<div>
<p>The polarization state of light is often manipulated using different kinds of optical <a href="waveplates.html" title="transparent plates with a defined amount of birefringence, used for modifying the polarization of light">waveplates</a>.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a half waveplate (<span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span></span>/2 plate), one may rotate a linear polarization state into any other direction.</li>
<li>With a quarter waveplate (<span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span></span>/4 plate), having its axis oriented at 45&deg; to the polarization direction, one may convert a linear polarization state to a circular one (and vice versa).</li>
<li>With a combination of one half waveplate and two quarter waveplates, one can realize a polarization controller, with which one can do arbitrary polarization conversions by properly rotating the three plates.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">True Polarization Rotation</h2>
<div>
<p>As explained above, a waveplate or other birefringent optical element may rotate the direction of linear polarization, but more generally one will obtain an elliptical polarization state after such an element.
True polarization rotation, where a linear polarization state is always maintained (just with variable direction), can occur in the form of <a href="optical_activity.html" title="the phenomenon that the polarization direction of light is rotated when light passes through certain transparent substances">optical activity</a>.
Some optically active substances such as ordinary sugar (saccharose) can produce substantial rotation angles already within e.g. a few millimeters of propagation length.
Optical activity can be accurately measured with <a href="polarimeters.html" title="instruments for measuring the rotation angle of optical polarization caused by optically active substances">polarimeters</a>.</p>
<p>While optical activity usually results from the presence of chiral molecules, with a concentration difference between the two possible enantiometers, it can also be induced by a magnetic field in a substance which is not naturally optically active.
That is called the Faraday effect, and is exploited in <a href="faraday_rotators.html" title="devices which can rotate the polarization state of light, exploiting the Faraday effect">Faraday rotators</a> and <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolators</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Radial and Azimuthal Polarization</h2>
<div>
<p>In the previous cases, the direction of the electric field vector was assumed to be constant over the full beam profile.
However, there are light beams where that is not the case.
For example, there are beams with <em>radial polarization</em>, where the polarization at any point on the beam profile is oriented in the radial direction, i.e., away from the beam axis.</p>
<p>Such a radially polarized beam may be generated from a linearly polarized beam with some optical element, but it is also possible to obtain radially polarized emission directly from a laser.
The advantage of this approach, applied in a <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk laser</a>, is that <a href="depolarization_loss.html" title="losses of optical power in a laser resonator, caused by depolarization e.g. in a laser crystal">depolarization loss</a> may be avoided [4].</p>
<p>There are also <em>azimuthally polarized beams</em>, where the electric field direction at any point is tangential, i.e., perpendicular to a line through the point and the beam axis.</p>
<p>Note that radial or azimuthal polarization state requires a zero electric field strength and thus also a vanishing <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a> on the beam axis; it is not compatible with a <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a>, for example.
Radially polarized beams frequently exhibit a kind of donut profile.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">p and s Polarization</h2>
<div>
<p>The polarization state of light often matters when light hits an  optical surface under some angle.
A linear polarization state is then denoted as <em>p polarization</em> when the polarization direction lies in the plane spanned by the incoming beam and the reflected beam.
The polarization with a direction perpendicular to that is called <em>s polarization</em>.
These indications have a German origin: s = senkrecht = perpendicular, p = parallel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the terms are also sometimes used with a different meaning in the context of <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a> [8].</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Jones Calculus</h2>
<div>
<p>The polarization state of <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic light</a> is often described with a Jones vector, having complex electric field amplitudes for <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> and <span class="eqn_il"><i>y</i></span> direction, if propagation occurs in <span class="eqn_il"><i>z</i></span> direction.
That Jones vector may be constant over some area across the beam, or it may vary, for example for a radially polarized beam (see above).
The effect of optical elements such as <a href="waveplates.html" title="transparent plates with a defined amount of birefringence, used for modifying the polarization of light">waveplates</a>, <a href="polarizers.html" title="optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizers</a> and <a href="faraday_rotators.html" title="devices which can rotate the polarization state of light, exploiting the Faraday effect">Faraday rotators</a> can be described with Jones matrices, with which the Jones vectors can be transformed by multiplication.
(One assumes a linear relationship between input and output amplitudes.)
A whole sequence of such optical elements can be described with a single Jones matrix, which is obtained as the product of the matrices corresponding to the components.</p>
<p>There are cases where <a href="polychromatic_light.html" title="light with multiple optical frequencies">polychromatic</a> light can be described with a single Jones vector, since all its frequency components have essentially the same polarization state.
However, the polarization state is substantially frequency-dependent in other cases.</p>
<p>Jones vectors can be used only for fully defined polarization states, not for unpolarized or partially polarized beams (see below) having a stochastic nature.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Unpolarized and Partially Polarized Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>A light beam is called unpolarized when the analysis with a <a href="polarizers.html" title="optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizer</a> results in 50&#37; of the power to be in each polarization state, regardless of the rotational orientation.
Microscopically, this usually means that the polarization state is randomly fluctuating, so that on average no polarization is detected.
Note that such fluctuations are not possible for strictly <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic light</a>.</p>
<p>Linearly polarized light can be depolarized (made unpolarized) with a polarization scrambler, which applies the mentioned random polarization changes, or at least quasi-random changes.</p>
<p>There are also partially polarized states of light.
These can be described with <em>Stokes vectors</em> (but not with Jones vectors).
Further, one can define a <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam"><em>degree of polarization</em></a> which can be calculated from the Stokes vector and can vary between 0 (unpolarized) and 1 (fully polarized).</p>
<p>Fully polarized states can be associated with points on the so-called Poincar&eacute; sphere.
Partially polarized states correspond to points inside that sphere; unpolarized light is represented by the point at its center.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Relevance of Polarization for Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>The polarization of light is important for a range of <a href="laser_applications.html" title="applications involving laser devices">applications</a>.
Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>setups where minimum reflection losses are obtained only for p polarization at optical surfaces (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="brewsters_angle.html" title="an angle of incidence at which there is no reflection of p-polarized light at an uncoated optical surface">Brewster's angle</a>)</li>
<li><a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>, where <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase matching</a> in a <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal</a> is normally obtained only for one polarization direction</li>
<li>processing of laser beams in polarization-dependent devices, such as <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a>, systems with <a href="polarization_beam_combining.html" title="a technique for combining two polarized laser beams">polarization beam combining</a>, <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifiers</a>, and <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulators</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Polarization Extinction Ratio</h2>
<div>
<p>The degree of linear polarization is often quantified with the <em>polarization extinction ratio</em> (PER), defined as the ratio of optical powers in the two polarization directions.
It is often specified in <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a>, and measured by recording the orientation-dependent power transmission of a <a href="polarizers.html" title="optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizer</a>.
Of course, the extinction ratio of the polarizer itself must be higher than that of the <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Polarization of Laser Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>In many cases the output of a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> is linearly polarized.
Different mechanisms can be responsible for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> may be polarization dependent.
This is the case in some anisotropic <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> (e.g. <a href="vanadate_lasers.html" title="lasers based on rare-earth-doped yttrium, gadolinium or lutetium vanadate crystals, usually Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>">Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub></a> or <a href="ylf_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YLF (yttrium lithium fluoride) crystals, usually Nd:YLF">Nd:YLF</a>), but also in some <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifiers</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> losses may be polarization-dependent, e.g. when the resonator contains a <a href="brewster_plates.html" title="coplanar plates inserted into beams at Brewster's angle">Brewster plate</a> or even only a slightly tilted optical component.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a very small gain or loss difference for the two polarization directions can be sufficient for obtaining a stable linear polarization, provided that there is no significant coupling of polarization modes within the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the polarization state of the laser output can be disturbed e.g. by random (and temperature-dependent) <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a>, such as occurs e.g. in optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> (if they are not <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining</a> or <a href="single_polarization_fibers.html" title="optical fibers which transmit only light with a certain polarization">single-polarization fibers</a>) and also in <a href="laser_crystals_versus_glasses.html">laser crystals or glasses</a> as a result of thermal effects (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="depolarization_loss.html" title="losses of optical power in a laser resonator, caused by depolarization e.g. in a laser crystal"><em>depolarization loss</em></a>).
If the laser gain is not polarization-dependent, small drifts of the birefringence may lead to large changes of the polarization state, and also a significant variation in the polarization state across the beam profile.</p>
