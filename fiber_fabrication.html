</header>
<p>There is a wide range of methods for the fabrication of <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">optical fibers</a>.
In a first step, these can be divided into methods involving a so-called <em>preform</em> and methods of direct fiber production.
Preform-based methods are most important at least in the context of glass fibers, whereas direct methods, e.g. based on extrusion, are common for <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic optical fibers</a>.
In the following, this article first discusses how a fiber can be made from a preform, then how preforms are fabricated, and finally methods not requiring a preform.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Pulling from a Preform</h2>
<div>
<p>Most glass fibers are fabricated by pulling from a so-called <em>preform</em> in a fiber-drawing tower, an apparatus which is typically several meters high.
The preform is a glass rod with a diameter between about 1&nbsp;cm and 10&nbsp;cm and roughly 1&nbsp;m to 2&nbsp;m length.
Along its axis, the preform contains a region with increased <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>, which will form the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>.
When the preform is heated close to the melting point in a furnace (oven) at the top of the drawing tower, a thin fiber can be pulled out of the bottom of the preform.
The fiber from a single preform can be many kilometers long.
During the pulling process, the fiber diameter is held constant by automatically adjusting the pulling speed (and possibly the furnace temperature) with an automatic feedback system (containing a diameter monitor below the furnace).</p>
<p>Fiber pulling works quite well for the usual <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>, since silica has a rather broad glass transition, i.e., a large range of temperatures in which the viscosity is in a suitable range.
Other materials, as used e.g. for <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride fibers</a>, have a much smaller temperature range suitable for pulling, and the method is accordingly more delicate.</p>
<p>Before the fiber is wound up, it usually receives a polymer coating for mechanical and chemical protection.
Such coatings can consist of two or more different layers for optimum suppression of <a href="bend_losses.html" title="propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">microbends</a>.
Typical coating materials used are acrylate, silicone and polyimide.
Additional PVC or similar protective coatings can be made by extrusion after the drawing process.</p>
<p>It is also possible to write type II <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a> into the fiber during the fabrication process.
For that purpose, <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> <a href="nanosecond_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting optical pulses with nanosecond durations">nanosecond laser</a> <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a> are shot at the fiber through some phase mask just before the fiber is coated.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fabrication of Fiber Preforms</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Vapor Deposition Methods</h3>
<div>
<p>Many fiber preforms are fabricated with a process called <em>modified chemical vapor deposition</em> (MCVD or just CVD).
This method was developed for <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica</a> <a href="telecom_fibers.html" title="optical fibers for use in optical fiber communications">telecom fibers</a> in the 1970s, with pioneering contributions from the University of Southampton (UK), Bell Telephone Laboratories (Bell Labs), and Corning.
Here, a mixture of oxygen, silicon tetrachloride (SiCl<sub>4</sub>) and possibly other substances (e.g. germanium tetrachloride (GeCl<sub>4</sub>) and <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare earth dopants</a> &rarr;&nbsp;<a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light"><em>fiber core</em></a>) is passed through a rotating silica glass tube, which is heated from outside to &asymp;&thinsp;1600&thinsp;&deg;C with a flame.
Chemical reactions in the gas form a fine soot of silica (and possibly other substances) which coats the inner surface of the glass tube near the burner and is sintered into a clear glass layer.
The burner is continuously moved back and forth along the tube.
Towards the end of the process, the gas mixture is modified to form a layer with higher refractive index, the precursor of the fiber core.
Finally, the tube is collapsed by heating it to &asymp;&thinsp;2000&thinsp;&deg;C.</p>
<p>Various alternative vapor deposition methods have been developed:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Outside vapor deposition</em> (OVD) is a process where the silica soot is deposited on the surface of some target rod (e.g. a glass mandrel), rather than inside a tube as with MCVD.
Together with the material precursors such as SiCl<sub>4</sub>, a fuel gas such as hydrogen or methane is supplied to a burner which is again moved along the rotating rod.
After the deposition, the target rod is removed, and the preform is consolidated in a furnace, where it is also purged with a drying gas for lowering the hydroxyl content.</li>
<li><em>Vapor phase axial deposition</em> (VAD or AVD) is similar to OVD, but uses a modified geometry, where the deposition occurs at the end of the target rod.
The rod is continuously pulled away from the burner, and very long preforms can be made.
Consolidation of the material can be done in a separate zone melting process.
An important difference to OVD and MCVD is that the doping profile is determined only by the burner geometry, rather than by a variation of the gas mixture over time.</li>
<li><em>Plasma chemical vapor deposition</em> (PCVD) uses deposition inside a tube, similar to MCVD.
However, microwaves instead of a burner are used for heating the deposition region.
The deposition is slow, but very precise.
A modified method with particularly high precision is <em>plasma impulse chemical vapor deposition</em> (PICVD), where short microwave pulses are used.
There is also <em>plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition</em> (PECVD), operating at atmospheric pressure with fairly high deposition rate.</li>
<li>The preforms for <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, particularly for large core fibers, are often fabricated using <em>plasma outside deposition</em> (POD), where an outer fluorine-doped layer with depressed refractive index, later forming the <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">fiber cladding</a>, is made with a plasma torch.
The core can then be made of pure silica, without any dopant.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general advantage of vapor deposition methods is that extremely low <a href="propagation_losses.html" title="losses of optical energy during propagation of light">propagation losses</a> down to below 0.2&nbsp;dB/km can be achieved, because very high-purity <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">materials</a> can be used and contamination is avoided.
In particular, SiCl<sub>4</sub> and GeCl<sub>4</sub> are easily purified by distillation, as they are liquid at room temperature.
Particularly when no hydrogen is present (e.g. as fuel gas), the water content of such preforms is very low, avoiding a strong loss peak at 1.4&nbsp;&mu;m, which would also affect the telecom bands (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers"><em>optical fiber communications</em></a>).</p>
<p>The different vapor deposition methods differ in many respects, e.g. concerning the possible material purity, the degree, precision and flexibility of refractive index control, the mechanical strength of the fabricated fibers, and the deposition efficiency and speed.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Methods Without Vapor Deposition</h3>
<div>
<p>For materials where vapor deposition can not be applied, the rod-in-tube technique is another option.
Here, a rod of a glass with higher refractive index is inserted into a glass tube with lower refractive index.
Both can be reasonably well connected by heating, but great care is required to avoid bubbles and other disturbances.
There are also casting methods where the molten core glass is poured into the cladding tube, or sucked into the tube using a vacuum pump.</p>
<p>Preforms for <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass"><em>photonic crystal fibers</em></a>, containing small holes throughout, are usually fabricated by stacking capillary tubes and/or rods, in most cases made of pure fused silica.
It is possible, of course, to introduce <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped</a> rods for <a href="active_fibers.html" title="optical fibers containing laser-active dopants in the fiber core">active</a> fiber devices.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Adapted Methods for Active Fibers</h3>
<div>
<p>For <a href="active_fibers.html" title="optical fibers containing laser-active dopants in the fiber core">active fiber</a> devices such as <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>, <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a> are required.
Here, the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> is doped with rare earth ions e.g. of <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium</a>, <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium</a>, <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium</a>, or thulium.
Additional dopants can modify the refractive index, improve the solubility for rare earth ions, or modify the photosensitivity.</p>
<p>Not all dopants can be easily incorporated with vapor deposition methods, requiring convective material transport.
In particular, precursors for rare earth dopants usually have a too low vapor pressure.
One possibility to overcome this problem is to expose the source of rare earth ions to a higher temperature.
For example, a glass tube as used for MCVD may contain an additional dopant chamber or a porous silica part soaked with a rare earth salt, which is heated with an additional burner.</p>
<p>Another common technique is <em>solution doping</em>, where initially a porous silica frit (not yet containing rare earth ions) is deposited on the inner side of a hollow silica tube.
This frit is then soaked with a solution containing a rare earth salt (e.g. a chloride).
Later on, the preform needs to be further processed to form a dry and compact rare earth oxide layer.</p>
<p>An alternative technique is <em>direct nanoparticle deposition</em> from some aerosol.
This method allows for high <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentrations</a> with good homogeneity and accurate control of the doping profile.</p>
<p>Also, sintering techniques [8] can be employed to fabricate rare-earth doped fiber cores.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fabrication Methods Not Involving a Preform</h2>
<div>
<p>Soft glass fibers are often fabricated with the <em>double crucible method</em>, where core and cladding are simultaneously drawn from the crucible.
The crucible has a reservoir for the molten core glass, leaving a small opening at the center, and one (or several) reservoirs for cladding glass.
The double crucible method is older than the vapor deposition methods and is still used e.g. for soft glasses.
Compared with drawing from a preform, it can be adapted more easily to different glass materials.
However, it is less suitable for producing ultrapure fibers with very low losses, as it is difficult to avoid any contamination with material from the crucible.</p>
<p>Some fibers, e.g. <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic optical fibers</a>, are produced in a simple extrusion process, which is similar to the double crucible method.
Such fibers are interesting for applications in mass markets, but do not reach top-level performance.</p>
