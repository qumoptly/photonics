<p class="ref">Ref.: V. Sudesh et al., &ldquo;Diode-pumped 200&thinsp;&mu;m diameter core, gain-guided, index-antiguided single mode fiber laser&rdquo;, Appl. Phys. B 90, 369 (2008); encyclopedia article on <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a> and references therein</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, famous Anthony E. Siegman has proposed an interesting new concept for an <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">active fiber</a>, which allows for robust <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> operation with an <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> well above that for any other of the many investigated concepts (to my best knowledge).
It took quite a while, but last year a collaboration of that group and others managed to demonstrate the first diode-pumped fiber laser based on the concept, after earlier experiments with <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">flash lamp pumping</a>.</p>
<p>The principle idea is really nice.
Naturally, the fiber would be anti-guiding, as the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> has a lower <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> than the <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">cladding</a>.
When the fiber is pumped sufficiently strongly, however, <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">gain guiding</a> stabilizes a &quot;<a href="leaky_modes.html" title="a concept for quasi-bound waveguide modes with propagation losses due to leakage into the cladding">leaky mode</a>&quot;, which constantly loses some power to the cladding during propagation.
However, when the core size is increased (which one wants anyway), that loss decreases rapidly and is thus not really detrimental.</p>
<p>The challenge is essentially that of pumping such a fiber.
Note that it cannot guide the pump light.
On the contrary, the index structure even tends to expel the pump light from the core.
For that reason, the first fibers operated with that guiding principle were side-pumped with <a href="flash_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps which are used for generating intense light pulses">flash lamps</a>, of course with a terribly low efficiency, just for demonstration purposes.
The diode-pumped laser demonstrated laser year still has a very low efficiency, exactly because of the difficulty of efficient pumping, whereas the output beam quality is high, as expected.</p>
<p>The researchers hope to develop improved pumping schemes to fix the efficiency problem, perhaps by going back to side pumping.
That may not be too bad for very <a href="large_core_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large fiber core">large-core fibers</a>, although it probably requires the use of short and highly doped fibers, leading to problems with thermal loading.
If these problems are overcome in some way, that concept may allow e.g. for amplifiers with <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a> well above those of any other fiber devices.</p>

<h2>Your Lab is Closed due to the Corona Virus Crisis?</h2>
<p>Time to think how to best utilize your time!</p>
<p>Here is a suggestion: <br> <b>Consider to start with physical modeling!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Build models for your existing or planned lasers and amplifiers, resonators, etc.</li>
<li>Utilize such models in order to <b>improve your qualitative and quantitative understanding</b>, solve problems, optimize device performance and <b>develop new ideas</b>.</li>
<li>Power up your home office instead of wasting your time!</li>
<li>When getting back to the lab, restart with fresh plans and full power.</li>
