</header>
<p>This article mainly deals with electronic band gaps (bandgaps), including their importance for the optical absorption and emission properties of materials.
There are also so-called <em>photonic band gaps</em>, which are briefly discussed in the last section of this article.</p>
<p>The application of quantum mechanics in solid-state physics has led to physical models which involve a continuum of states which can be occupied by electrons.
Each state has a certain energy and <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector (crystal momentum).
As electrons are fermions, each of those states can be occupied by one electron only.
At very low temperatures, the electrons will occupy the levels with the lowest possible energies.
(If one imagines to fill more and more electron into such a system, the electrons will first occupy the very lowest energy levels and then levels with increasingly higher energies, as the lower ones are already occupied.)
At a finite temperature (room temperature, for example), the distribution of electrons over the electronic states is described with a Fermi function, which drops with increasing energy.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The band gap of central importance is that near the Fermi energy.</aside>
<p>It turns out that there are energy regions for which no electronic states exist.
These are called <em>band gaps</em>.
A medium can have many of those, but the band gap of central importance is that near the Fermi energy, where the level occupation according to the Fermi function drops substantially.
That is the band gap which is usually meant when the text mentions <em>the</em> band gap of a material.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Materials with Different Electronic Structures</h2>
<div>
<p>The electrical and optical properties of a material strongly depend on their electronic structure:</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Dielectrics</h3>
<div>
<p>In some cases, the Fermi energy lies somewhere in a large band gap (with a width of e.g. above 4&nbsp;eV), so that all bands below that energy are completely filled, while all higher-lying bands are completely empty, except for some thermal excitation which is negligibly unless at high temperatures.
Such materials are called <em>dielectrics</em> or <em>insulators</em>.
They are electrically insulating, essentially because the combined contribution of each band to the current density is zero, and any rearrangement of occupation within the completely filled bands is not possible.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The transparency of dielectrics results from the absence of any target states reachable with the given photon energy.</aside>
<p>Further, dielectrics generally cannot absorb visible or near-infrared <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a>, because the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> energy is not sufficient for transitions from the valence band (the highest filled band) to the conduction band (the lowest empty band), or in fact for any kinds of transitions of carriers.
Only in the <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> region, photon energies become sufficient for interband transitions, causing strong <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a>.
Furthermore, there is strong infrared absorption at longer wavelengths, which is associated with the generation of <a href="phonons.html" title="quantized microscopic vibrations in solid media">phonons</a>, and weaker absorption caused by multi-phonon absorption processes.</p>
<p>At very high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a>, it is possible to have <a href="multiphoton_absorption.html" title="absorption processes where multiple photons are absorbed simultaneously">multiphoton absorption</a> (e.g. <a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">two-photon absorption</a>), where two or more photons are absorbed at the same time, and the combined photon energy is available for the transition of a single carrier.
Such processes often play a role in <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">laser-induced damage</a>, for example.
However, they are generally negligible at moderate intensities, e.g. even in bright sun light.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Semiconductors</h3>
<div>
<p>In semiconductors, the Fermi energy also lies in a band gap, but the band gap has a smaller width of only a few electron volts or even less than 1&nbsp;eV.</p>
<p>A first consequence of the narrow band gap is some electrical conductivity, since thermal excitation e.g. at room temperature creates some small population of the conduction band and a corresponding population of holes in the valence band.
An applied electric field leads to a slight rearrangement of population within the production and balance brand, which results in an electrical current.
Note, however, that the conductivity varies a lot between different semiconductors, mainly due to the strong dependence on the band gap energy.</p>
<p>Another consequence is that photons with moderate energy (e.g. in the visible spectral region) can cause interband transitions, i.e., from the valence band to the conduction band.
Therefore, semiconductors (at least those with a narrow band gap) appear opaque and can transmit only infrared light &ndash; and that with a rather high <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>.
The details, however, substantially depend on whether we have a direct or indirect band gap &ndash; see below.</p>
<p>The table below lists the band gap type and energy of various semiconductors at room temperature.
It does not include ternary and quaternary compounds where those properties depend on a composition parameter.</p>

<h3 class="togglediv">Metals and Semimetals</h3>
<div>
<p>In metals, the Fermi energy lies within a band, which is thus only partially occupied.
In that situation, it is possible to induce a rearrangement of population within that partially filled band, which turns out to enable a substantial electrical conductivity.</p>
<p>Concerning optical properties of metals, there is strong reflection and absorption of light.
Only for <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequencies</a> above the plasma frequency (of the order of a couple of petahertz), a metal becomes transparent.
One exploits that for <a href="metal_coated_mirrors.html" title="mirrors where the reflection is obtained from a metal coating">metal-coated mirrors</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Semimetals have similar electronic properties, only that the density of states near the Fermi energy is relatively small.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">The Band Gap Energy</h2>
<div>
<p>In case of dielectrics (insulators) and semiconductors, the <em>band gap energy</em> is understood to be the width of the energy gap between conduction and valence band.
For metals, one would have to ask which band gap is meant.</p>
<p>For single-photon processes, the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> corresponding to a given band gap energy <span class="eqn_il"><i>E</i><sub>g</sub></span> can be calculated as</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/bandgap_wavelength.gif" width="57" height="48" alt="band gap wavelength"></div>
<p>or numerically as 1.235 divided by the band gap energy in electron volts, obtaining the band gap wavelength in units of micrometers.</p>

<h3 class="togglediv">Direct Band Gap</h3>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:234px;">
<img src="img/direct_bandgap.png" alt="direct band gap">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
In cases with a direct band gap, the minimum of the conduction band coincides with the maximum of the valence band. Emission will usually occur with photon energies close to the band gap energy, while absorption is also possible at shorter wavelengths.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A direct band gap is defined as one where the <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector (not only its magnitude, but also its direction) is about the same for the highest states in the valence band as for the lowest states in the conduction band.
(The <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector is associated with the position within the Brillouin zone.)
This is relevant for optical transitions.
These involve only a minor change of the magnitude of the <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector, because the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> is much longer than the interatomic distances or the lattice period.
In case of a direct band gap, optical transitions are possible as soon as the photon energy exceeds the band gap energy (see Figure&nbsp;1).
Such a process excites one carrier from the valence band to the conduction band while leaving a hole (i.e., an unoccupied state) in the valence band.
It is only that the density of initial and final states is typically quite small just at the band gap energy, but the <a href="absorption_coefficient.html" title="a logarithmic measure for the distributed absorption in a medium">absorption coefficient</a> then rises steeply for increasing photon energies &ndash; in proportion to the square root of the difference of photon energy and band gap energy.
Somewhat above the band gap energy, the <a href="absorption_length.html" title="the length of which absorption reduces the optical intensity to 1/e of its initial value">absorption length</a> can drop to the order of a micrometer.
It also implies that the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> has a large imaginary component.</p>
<p>Similarly, emission processes corresponding to transitions from the conduction band to the valence band are easily possible, since every electron in the conduction band (typically occupying one of the lowest levels there) can find a hole in the valence band which has a very similar <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector, since the holes naturally occur in states with the highest possible energies.
Therefore, the carrier lifetime is usually relatively low, for example a few nanoseconds, even if the crystal structure is of high quality (with a low defect density).</p>
<p>Examples for direct band gap semiconductor materials are gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), aluminum nitride (AlN), cadmium sulfide (CdS), cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium tellurite (CdTe), zinc sulfide (ZnS), lead sulfide (PbS) and lead selenide (PbSe).</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Indirect Band Gap</h3>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:272px;">
<img src="img/indirect_bandgap.png" alt="indirect band gap">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
In cases with an indirect band gap, additional phonons need to be involved in absorption and emission processes in order to provide the required momentum change of electrons.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In case of an indirect band gap, the <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector of the lowest states in the conduction band substantially differs from that for the highest states in the valence band.
As a consequence, absorption processes with photon energies only slightly above the band gap energy are hindered by the fact that there are no target states in the conduction band which have a suitable energy in addition to a suitable <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector.
In other words, one cannot simultaneously fulfill energy conservation and momentum conservation &ndash; except if the additional emission of a <a href="phonons.html" title="quantized microscopic vibrations in solid media">phonon</a> is involved, which can provide the required change of electron momentum while having little impact on the energy balance (see Figure&nbsp;2).
Such processes are possible, but occur at much lower rates; therefore, the <a href="absorption_coefficient.html" title="a logarithmic measure for the distributed absorption in a medium">absorption coefficient</a> is much reduced.
Also, the wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficient near the band gap is weaker.
The absorption coefficient is also substantially temperature-dependent, since the temperature affects the phonon populations.
For substantially higher photon energies, however, it becomes possible to directly excite carriers into the conduction band, not requiring phonons.
In that regime, the absorption coefficient becomes quite high &ndash; several orders of magnitude higher than close to the band gap.</p>
<p>Similarly, emission processes related to recombination are hindered by the fact that a carrier in the conduction band can hardly find a hole with suitable <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector; any target states with that <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector are occupied.
Therefore, emission processes are only possible by also involving the emission of a phonon.
Again, this requirement substantially reduces the recombination rate and emission rate.
That can also easily reduce the <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a> of <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a>, since other (non-radiative) recombination processes, provided e.g. by crystal defects (see below), can become dominant without having particularly high rates.</p>
<p>Examples for indirect band gap semiconductor materials are silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), aluminum arsenide (AlAs) and gallium phosphide (GaP).</p>
<p>Because of the reduced absorption coefficients, silicon layers in <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> and solar cells, for example, need to be substantially thicker &ndash; often hundreds of micrometers instead of only a couple of micrometers.
For thin-film solar cells, one needs to use direct band gap materials (e.g. cadmium tellurite).
Also, silicon is essentially unsuitable for <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light emitting diodes</a>.
Generally, the indirect band gap is often a challenge for <a href="silicon_photonics.html" title="photonic technology based on silicon chips">silicon photonics</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Importance of the Band Gap Energy for Photonic Devices</h2>
<div>
<p>The band gap energy is important for various kinds of photonic devices.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The emission wavelengths of <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light emitting diodes</a> and <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> are largely determined by the band gap energy.
The higher that energy, the shorter the wavelengths.
Note that the strongest emission occurs at photon energy is slightly above the band gap energy, particularly in situations with high carrier densities.
This is because the density of states steeply arises with increasing frequency.</li>
<li><a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">Photodiodes</a> and other semiconductor <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> can have a substantial <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> only for photon energies above the band gap energy, because that is the precondition for effective <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> which leads to the required <a href="photocurrent.html" title="an electric current which is induced by incident light in a photodetector">photocurrent</a>.
Close to the band gap energy, the responsivity normally falls off substantially due to the reduced density of states.</li>
<li>Solar cells can also only utilize light with photon energies above the band gap.
Therefore, sun light with to long wavelength cannot be utilized.
While that problem could in principle be solved by using a material was pretty small band gap energy, the result would be a low operation voltage, i.e., a low energy output per delivered carrier.
The shorter-wavelength photons would then be poorly utilized, even if each of them could contribute an electron to the generated current.
Therefore, the band gap needs to be chosen based on a compromise between efficient absorption of broadband sun light and a high voltage output.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="togglediv">Band Gap Engineering</h2>
<div>
<p>Ternary and quaternary semiconductor compounds usually have a composition parameter, which influences the band gap properties, in particular the band gap energy.
For example, one often uses indium gallium arsenide = InGaAs, more precisely In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1&minus;x</sub>As.
The composition parameter <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> indicates the fraction of indium which is added to replace gallium.
The larger that parameter, the smaller is the band gap energy.
The adjustment of such parameters for obtaining the desired band gap energy &ndash; for example, in order to obtain a specific emission wavelength of a <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> or the desired absorption edge of a <a href="semiconductor_saturable_absorber_mirrors.html" title="saturable semiconductor absorber devices acting as nonlinear mirrors">semiconductor saturable absorber mirror</a> (SESAM), is called <em>band gap engineering</em>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Quantum Wells and Quantum Dots</h2>
<div>
<p>So far, we have considered only homogeneous materials.
If a material is inhomogeneous, for example containing <a href="quantum_wells.html" title="thin layers confining carriers in one dimension">quantum well</a> or <a href="quantum_dots.html" title="microscopic structures confining charge carriers in three dimensions">quantum dot</a> structures, the electronic properties around those structures are modified.
Frequently, one has a locally reduced band gap energy, so that quantum wells or dots in a medium can be absorbing even if the surrounding medium is not absorbing due to a too high band gap energy.
(That often occurs in <a href="semiconductor_saturable_absorber_mirrors.html" title="saturable semiconductor absorber devices acting as nonlinear mirrors">semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors</a>.)
Similarly, quantum wells e.g. in <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> can emit light which will not be absorbed by the surrounding semiconductor medium.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Effect of Impurities and Crystal Defects</h2>
<div>
<p>The above considerations all applied to intrinsic materials.
Additional electronic states can be provided by impurities (often intentionally introduced as dopants) and crystal defects (which may also be intentionally increased, e.g. with low-temperature growth).
Grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials can also be considered as crystal defects.</p>
<p>Frequently, there are additional electronic levels created within a band gap, and those can play important roles.
For example, they can facilitate light absorption, and they can lead to the quenching of <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a>.
Case of extrinsic <a href="photoconductive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which exhibit a reduction in electrical resistance caused by incoming light">photoconductive detectors</a>, such defect states are even vital for the performance.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Photonic Band Gaps</h2>
<div>
<p>In certain situations, so-called photonic band gaps arise; here, one considers states of the <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> field rather than states of electrons.
Just as an electron cannot be described with a plane de Broglie wave in a medium with a periodically varying electric potential, optical <a href="plane_waves.html" title="waves with plane wavefronts">plane waves</a> are no solutions of the wave equation in a medium with a periodically varying <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>.
The analysis of those situations, occurring in certain <a href="photonic_metamaterials.html" title="nanostructured materials with special optical properties">photonic metamaterials</a>, one also finds that there are certain regions of the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> energy for which there are no states.
That implies that light with such photon energies cannot propagate over substantial distances in the medium &ndash; they may penetrate into such a structure, but with an exponentially decaying optical amplitude.
That effect can be utilized for confining light, for example in a region around the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> of a <a href="photonic_bandgap_fibers.html" title="optical fibers where light is guided based on a photonic bandgap effect">photonic bandgap fiber</a>.</p>
