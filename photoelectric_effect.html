<p>The operation principles of many types of <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> &ndash; e.g. <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a>, <a href="phototransistors.html" title="a type of semiconductor-based photodetector with internal current amplification for higher responsivity">phototransistors</a>, <a href="phototubes.html" title="gas-filled or vacuum tubes which can be used as photodetectors">phototubes</a> and CCD or CMOS <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensors</a> &ndash; are based on the photoelectric effect.
This actually comes in two quite different forms: the external and internal photoelectric effect.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">External Photoelectric Effect</h2>
<div>
<p>If light with a sufficiently high <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> energy (above the so-called work function) hits a metal (or semiconductor) surface, for example, some of the light may be <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorbed</a>, and electrons are emitted from the surface.
If the metal part (called a <a href="photocathodes.html" title="an electrode where electrons can be released based on the photoelectric effect"><em>photocathode</em></a>) is kept in vacuum and an electric field is applied using a second electrode (the <em>anode</em>), which attracts those electrons, one can detect a <a href="photocurrent.html" title="an electric current which is induced by incident light in a photodetector">photocurrent</a>, which is proportional to the incident light <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">intensity</a>.
The <em>external photoelectric effect</em> provides the working principle of a vacuum <a href="phototubes.html" title="gas-filled or vacuum tubes which can be used as photodetectors">phototube</a>.
Here, <em>external</em> means that the electrons are obtained outside the material from which they have been released.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Observations on the photoelectric effect contributed to the early development of quantum theory.</aside>
<p>That form of photoelectric effect, discovered in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, found substantial attention by Philipp Lenard, Albert Einstein and others in the early 20th century.
It had been observed that the photoelectric effect occurs only for light with <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> below a certain limit, depending on the material; for longer wavelengths, even rather high optical intensities cannot give rise to that effect.
Also, Lenard noticed that the maximum energy of photoelectrons (measured via a required stopping potential) was independent on the light intensity, contrary to expectations.
Instead, that maximum energy depends on the optical wavelength: the shorter the wavelength, the higher the photoelectron energy, while the light intensity only affects the rate of photoelectrons emission.
Those observations, which were hard to reconcile with classical electromagnetic theory, led to the idea that light energy is delivered in the form of small packages, which have later been named <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy"><em>photons</em></a>.
They thus contributed to the early development of quantum mechanics and <a href="quantum_optics.html" title="the part of optics which deals with quantum effects">quantum optics</a>.</p>
<p>The photon model well explains the mentioned observations.
Only if a photon has a sufficiently high energy, it can trigger the emission of a photoelectrons &ndash; a process which requires a certain energy, namely the binding energy plus the resulting kinetic energy of the electron.
A more detailed explanation involves solid-state physics with features like energy bands and Fermi energy.</p>
<p>The external photoelectric effect is utilized in vacuum tube photodetectors, in particular in <a href="phototubes.html" title="gas-filled or vacuum tubes which can be used as photodetectors">phototubes</a> and <a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultiplier tubes</a>, but also in <a href="infrared_viewers.html" title="instruments for observing scenes with infrared light">infrared viewers</a>, <a href="streak_cameras.html" title="devices for measuring the power of an optical pulse versus time">streak cameras</a>, <a href="image_intensifiers_and_image_converters.html" title="instruments which can intensify images acquired under faint light conditions, or convert images to other wavelengths">image intensifiers</a> (image amplifiers) and <a href="image_intensifiers_and_image_converters.html" title="instruments which can intensify images acquired under faint light conditions, or convert images to other wavelengths">image converters</a>.
Besides, pulsed photocathodes, which are illuminated with <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort laser pulses</a>, are used in some particle accelerators.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Internal Photoelectric Effect</h2>
<div>
<p>The <em>internal</em> photoelectric effect does not produce photoelectrons which are observable outside the material, but only excites electrons to higher levels, namely from the valence band to the conduction band in a semiconductor material.
A consequence of that is that a photocurrent is usually detected in a reverse-biased p&ndash;n junction or p&ndash;i&ndash;n junction.
For explanations on the latter case, see the article on <a href="p_i_n_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with a p&ndash;i&ndash;n semiconductor structure">p&ndash;i&ndash;n photodiodes</a>.
There are also <a href="metal_semiconductor_metal_photodetectors.html" title="fast photodetector devices based on metal&ndash;semiconductor (Schottky) contacts">metal&ndash;semiconductor&ndash;metal photodetectors</a>, where a Schottky junction is used.</p>
<p>The internal photoelectric effect is exploited in various types of semiconductor photodetectors, namely in <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> and <a href="phototransistors.html" title="a type of semiconductor-based photodetector with internal current amplification for higher responsivity">phototransistors</a>.
Its precondition is that the photon energy is larger than the <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a> of the material in the active region.
While the bandgap energy of typical dielectrics like silica or other <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">optical glasses</a> is substantially too large, and also the carrier lifetime would be too short, various semiconductors exhibit a suitably small bandgap energy.
For example, silicon-based detectors can work with wavelengths up to roughly 1.1&nbsp;&mu;m, although the <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> often drops substantially above 1&nbsp;&mu;m.
Materials with still lower bandgap energy allow photodetection at longer wavelengths &ndash; for example, indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) up to &approx;1.7&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
<p>There are even materials for the detection of mid-infrared light, e.g. in <a href="infrared_cameras.html" title="cameras which work with infrared light">infrared cameras</a>.
Their bandgap energy is so small that substantial thermal excitation occurs already at room temperature.
To avoid that, such detectors need to be operated at substantially lower temperatures, e.g. using a Stirling cooler.</p>
