<p>Laser diodes are electrically pumped <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a> in which the <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> is generated by an electrical current flowing through a p&ndash;n junction or (more frequently) a p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure.
In such a heterostructure of a <em>bipolar interband laser</em>, electrons and holes can recombine, releasing the energy portions as <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>.
This process can be <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous</a>, but can also be <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated</a> by incident photons, in effect leading to optical amplification, and with optical feedback in a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> to <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> oscillation.
The article on <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a> describes more in detail how the laser amplification process in a semiconductor works.</p>
<p><a href="diode_lasers.html" title="semiconductor laser devices based on laser diodes"><em>Diode lasers</em></a> are <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> based on one or several <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>.</p>
<p>Most <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a> are based on laser diodes, but there are also some types of semiconductor lasers not requiring a diode structure and thus not belong to the category of diode lasers.
In particular, there are <a href="quantum_cascade_lasers.html" title="semiconductor lasers relying on intersubband transitions, normally emitting in the mid-infrared spectral region">quantum cascade lasers</a> and <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">optically pumped</a> semiconductor lasers.
The latter can be made of undoped semiconductor materials which cannot conduct significant electrical currents.</p>

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Schematic setup of an edge-emitting low-power laser diode. The waveguide and the output beam emerging at one edge of the wafer die are shown, but not the electrode structures.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most laser diodes (LDs) are built as <a href="edge_emitting_semiconductor_lasers.html" title="semiconductor lasers emitting light along the plane of the wafer">edge-emitting lasers</a>, where the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> is formed by coated or uncoated end facets (cleaved edges) of the semiconductor wafer.
They are often based on a double heterostructure, which restricts the generated carriers to a narrow region and at the same time serves as a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> for the optical field (<em>double confinement</em>).
The current flow is restricted to the same region, sometimes using isolating barriers.
Such arrangements lead to a relatively low <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump power</a> and high <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">efficiency</a>.
The active region is usually quite thin &ndash; often so thin that it acts as a <a href="quantum_wells.html" title="thin layers confining carriers in one dimension">quantum well</a>.
In some cases, <a href="quantum_dots.html" title="microscopic structures confining charge carriers in three dimensions">quantum dots</a> are used.</p>
<p>Some modern kinds of LDs are of the <a href="surface_emitting_semiconductor_lasers.html" title="semiconductor lasers where the generated light propagates in the direction perpendicular to the wafer surface">surface-emitting</a> type (see below), where the emission direction is perpendicular to the wafer surface, and the gain is provided by multiple quantum wells.</p>
<p>There are very different kinds of LDs, operating in very different regimes of optical output power, <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>, bandwidth, and other properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small edge-emitting LDs generate between a few milliwatts and up to roughly half a watt of output power in a beam with high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
The output may be emitted into free space or coupled into a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>.
Such lasers can be designed to be either <em>index guiding</em> (with a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> structure guiding the laser light within the LD) or <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain"><em>gain guiding</em></a> (where the beam profile is kept narrow via preferential amplification on the beam axis).</li>
<li>Small LDs made as <a href="distributed_feedback_lasers.html" title="lasers where the whole laser resonator consists of a periodic structure, in which Bragg reflection occurs">distributed feedback lasers</a> (DFB lasers) or <a href="distributed_bragg_reflector_lasers.html" title="lasers containing distributed Bragg reflectors as end mirrors">distributed Bragg reflector lasers</a> (DBR lasers) with short <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonators</a> can achieve <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a>, sometimes combined with <a href="tunable_lasers.html" title="lasers the output wavelengths of which can be tuned">wavelength tunability</a>.</li>
<li><a href="external_cavity_diode_lasers.html" title="non-monolithic diode lasers where the laser cavity (resonator) is completed with external optical elements">External cavity diode lasers</a> contain a laser diode as the gain medium of a longer laser resonator, completed with additional optical elements such as <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a> or a <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction grating</a>.
They are often <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength-tunable</a> and exhibit a small emission <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a>.</li>
<li><a href="broad_area_laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes with a strongly asymmetric shape of the emitting region">Broad area laser diodes</a> (also often called <em>broad stripe laser diodes</em> or <em>wide stripe lasers</em>) generate up to a few watts of output power.
The <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> is significantly poorer than that of lower-power LDs, but better than that of diode bars (see below).</li>
<li><a href="high_brightness_laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes with particularly high radiance (brightness)"><em>High brightness laser diodes</em></a> are laser diodes which are optimized for a particularly high <a href="radiance.html" title="the optical power per unit area and solid angle">radiance</a> (<a href="brightness.html" title="a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: often used instead of radiance or luminance">brightness</a>).
Different technologies may be used, and such lasers are available on quite different power levels.</li>
<li>Slab-coupled optical waveguide lasers (SCOWLs), containing a multi-quantum well gain region in a relatively large waveguide, can generate a watt-level output in a diffraction-limited beam with a nearly circular profile.</li>
<li>High-power <a href="diode_bars.html" title="a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a> contain an array of broad-area emitters, generating tens of watts with poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
Despite the higher power, the <a href="brightness.html" title="a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: often used instead of radiance or luminance">brightness</a> is lower than that of a broad area LD.</li>
<li>High-power stacked diode bars (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="diode_stacks.html" title="arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power"><em>diode stacks</em></a>) are stacks of multiple diode bars for the generation of extremely high powers of hundreds or thousands of watts.</li>
<li>Monolithic <a href="surface_emitting_semiconductor_lasers.html" title="semiconductor lasers where the generated light propagates in the direction perpendicular to the wafer surface">surface-emitting semiconductor lasers</a> (VCSELs) typically generate a few milliwatts with high beam quality.
There are also external-cavity versions of such lasers (<a href="vertical_external_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="surface-emitting semiconductor lasers with an external laser resonator">VECSELs</a>) which can generate much higher powers with still excellent beam quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laser diodes may emit a beam into free space, but many LDs are also available in <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled</a> form.
The latter makes it particularly convenient to use them, e.g., as pump sources for <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Emission Wavelengths</h2>
<div>
<p>The emission wavelength of a laser diode is essentially determined by the <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap</a> of the laser-active semiconductor material: the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> energy is close to the <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a>.
In <a href="quantum_wells.html" title="thin layers confining carriers in one dimension">quantum well</a> lasers, there is also some influence of the quantum well thickness.
A variety of semiconductor materials makes it possible to cover wide spectral regions.
In particular, there are many ternary and quaternary semiconductor compounds, where the bandgap energy can be adjusted in a wide range simply by varying the composition details.
For example, an increased aluminum content (increased x) in Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1&minus;x</sub>As causes an increase in the bandgap energy and thus a shorter emission wavelength.

<p>Note that there some laser diodes operating outside the spectral regions given in the table.
For example, InGaN lasers may be optimized for longer emission wavelengths, reaching the green spectral region, although typically with lower performance.
Besides, there are e.g. lead salt diodes for generating <a href="mid_infrared_laser_sources.html" title="light sources emitting mid-infrared radiation in the form of a laser-like beam">mid infrared</a> light.</p>
<p>Most laser diodes emit in the near-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region, but others can emit <a href="visible_lasers.html" title="lasers (or other laser-based light sources) emitting visible light">visible</a> (particularly <a href="red_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting red light">red</a> or <a href="blue_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting blue light">blue</a>) light or mid-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Emission Bandwidth and Wavelength Tuning</h2>
<div>
<p>Most LDs emit a beam with an optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of a few nanometers.
This bandwidth results from the simultaneous oscillation of multiple longitudinal (and possibly transverse) <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> (<em>multimode laser diodes</em>).
Some other kinds of LDs, particularly <a href="distributed_feedback_lasers.html" title="lasers where the whole laser resonator consists of a periodic structure, in which Bragg reflection occurs">distributed feedback lasers</a>, operate on a single resonator mode (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power"><em>single-frequency operation</em></a>), so that the emission bandwidth is much narrower, typically with a <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> in the megahertz region.
Further linewidth narrowing is possible with <a href="external_cavity_diode_lasers.html" title="non-monolithic diode lasers where the laser cavity (resonator) is completed with external optical elements">external cavities</a> and particularly with narrowband optical feedback from a <a href="reference_cavities.html" title="optical cavities serving as a kind of frequency reference">reference cavity</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities"><em>stabilization of lasers</em></a>).</p>
<p>The emission wavelength (center of the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>) of multimode LDs is usually temperature sensitive, typically with an increase of &asymp;&thinsp;0.3&nbsp;nm per 1&nbsp;K temperature rise, resulting from the temperature dependence of the <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> maximum.
(The temperature influences the thermal population distributions in the valence and conduction band.)
For that reason, the junction temperature of LDs for <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode pumping</a> of <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> has to be stabilized, if the <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">absorption</a> bandwidth of the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> is narrow (e.g. only a few nanometers wide).
It is also possible to <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">tune the emission wavelength</a> via the junction temperature.</p>
<p>Single-mode diodes can have a significantly smaller temperature coefficient of the emission wavelength, as the resonance frequencies react less to temperature changes than the optical gain does.
For applications in scanning <a href="laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="methods of absorption spectroscopy using laser light">laser absorption spectroscopy</a>, the wavelength is sometimes scanned by operating the laser intermittently.
The temperature then rises during each current pulse and causes the optical frequency to fall.
The wavelength of external-cavity lasers can also be tuned, e.g. by rotating the <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction grating</a> in the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser cavity</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Voltage&ndash;Current Characteristics</h2>
<div>
<p>Laser diodes have voltage&ndash;current characteristics like other diodes.
A substantial current flows only above for certain critical voltage, which depends on the used material system.
(The critical voltage is roughly proportional to the bandgap energy of the material and also depends somewhat on the device temperature.)
Above the critical voltage, the current rises rapidly with increasing voltage.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/ld_ui.png" alt="voltage-current characteristics of a laser diode">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Current vs. applied voltage for an 808-nm laser diode. For a current of 1.2&nbsp;A, as needed for the nominal output power of 1&nbsp;W, the required voltage is roughly 1.8&nbsp;V.
(For comparison, the photon energy for 808&nbsp;nm is 1.53&nbsp;eV.)
Note that this curve is shifted to the right for increasing device temperature; one then obtains a higher current for the same voltage.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A laser diodes is normally <em>not</em> operated by applying a fixed voltage, because the flowing current could then very sensitively depend on that voltage, and could also be substantially affected by the device temperature.
There could even be a catastrophic runaway effect: a high current could lead to a strong temperature rise, which could further increase the current, finally destroying the diode.
Therefore, in practice one usually uses a <a href="laser_diode_drivers.html" title="electronic current supplies for one or several laser diodes">laser diode driver</a> which stabilizes a certain current; this means that it automatically adjusts the voltage such that the desired current is obtained.
Alternatively, one uses a <em>constant power mode</em>, where the drive current is automatically adjusted for achieving the desired output power.</p>
<p>Note that the current rather than the voltage determines the rate with which carriers are injected into the laser diode.
Therefore, there is a strong relation between the flowing current and the emitted <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
There is essentially no output power below a certain threshold current, and above the laser threshold the output power grows roughly in proportion to the current minus the threshold current.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Power Conversion Efficiency</h2>
<div>
<p>Diode lasers can reach high <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">electrical-to-optical efficiencies</a> &ndash; typically of the order of 50&#37;, sometimes even above 60&#37; or even above 70&#37; [7].
The efficiency is usually limited by factors such as the electrical resistance, carrier leakage, <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattering</a>, <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> (particularly in doped regions), and <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a>.
Particularly high efficiencies are achieved with laser diodes emitting e.g. around 940&ndash;980&nbsp;nm (as used e.g. for pumping <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber devices</a>), whereas 808-nm diodes are somewhat less efficient.</p>
<p>The highest power conversion efficiency is typically achieved not for the highest output power, but for a somewhat reduced output power, because the required voltage is then lower.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Beam Quality and Beam Shaping</h2>
<div>
<p>Some low-power LDs can emit beams with relatively high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> (even though the high <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> requires some care to preserve that during <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimation</a>).
Most higher-power LDs, however, exhibit a relatively poor beam quality, combined with other non-favorable properties, such as a large <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, high asymmetry of <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> and beam quality between two perpendicular directions, and <a href="astigmatism.html" title="a kind of optical aberrations; alternatively, a defect of optical lenses or a property of laser beams">astigmatism</a>.
It is not always trivial to find the best design for <a href="beam_shapers.html" title="optical devices for modifying the shapes of laser beams">beam shaping</a> optics, being compact, easy to manufacture and align, preserving the beam quality and avoiding <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> fringes, removing astigmatism, having low losses, etc.
Typical parts of such diode laser beam shaping optics are collimating <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a> (spherical or cylindrical), <a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">apertures</a> and <a href="anamorphic_prism_pairs.html" title="prisms pairs for reshaping laser beams">anamorphic prism pairs</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Beam Combining</h2>
<div>
<p>As the light emitted by a laser diode is <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">linearly polarized</a>, it is possible to combine the outputs of two diodes with a polarizing <a href="beam_splitters.html" title="devices for splitting a laser beam into two or more beams">beam splitter</a>, so that an unpolarized beam with twice the power of a single diode but the same beam quality can be obtained (<em>polarization multiplexing</em>).
Alternatively, it is possible to combine the beams of LDs with slightly different wavelengths using <a href="dichroic_mirrors.html" title="mirrors with significantly different reflection or transmission properties at two different wavelengths">dichroic mirrors</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="spectral_beam_combining.html" title="a class of methods for beam combining, based on wavelength-sensitive beam combiners"><em>spectral beam combining</em></a>).
More systematic approaches of <a href="beam_combining.html" title="a class of techniques for power scaling of laser sources by combining the outputs of multiple devices">beam combining</a> allow combining a larger numbers of emitters with a good output beam quality.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Pulse Generation</h2>
<div>
<p>Although the most common <a href="modes_of_laser_operation.html" title="a mode of operation such as continuous-wave operation, Q-switched or mode-locked operation">mode of operation</a> of LDs is <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a>, many LDs can also generate optical <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a>.
In most cases, the principle of pulse generation is <a href="gain_switching.html" title="a technique for generating short optical pulses in a laser by modulating the laser gain">gain switching</a>, i.e. modulating the optical gain by switching the pump current.
Small diodes can also be <a href="mode_locking.html" title="a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode-locked</a> for generating picosecond or even femtosecond pulses.
Mode-locked laser diodes can be <a href="external_cavity_diode_lasers.html" title="non-monolithic diode lasers where the laser cavity (resonator) is completed with external optical elements">external-cavity devices</a> or monolithic, in the latter cases often containing different sections operated with different current.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Noise Properties</h2>
<div>
<p>Different types of diodes have very different <a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">noise</a> properties.
The <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a> is typically close to <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum-limited</a> only well above the <a href="relaxation_oscillations.html" title="small mutually coupled oscillations of the laser power and laser gain around their steady-state values">relaxation oscillation</a> frequency, which is very high (often several gigahertz).
However, some low-power LDs operated at cryogenic temperatures have been demonstrated to exhibit even significant <a href="squeezed_states_of_light.html" title="nonclassical states of light with noise below the standard quantum limit in one quadrature component">amplitude squeezing</a>, i.e., intensity noise well below the <a href="shot_noise.html" title="quantum-limited intensity noise">shot noise</a> limit.
In all semiconductor lasers, intensity noise is generally coupled to <a href="phase_noise.html" title="noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a>, making these noise properties strongly correlated.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> values are very different.
Multimode LDs exhibit a lot of excess noise associated with <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">mode hops</a>.
Noise in different modes can be strongly anti-correlated, so that the intensity noise in single modes can be much stronger than the noise of the combined power.
This has the important consequence that the intensity noise can be increased when the beam e.g. of a diode bar is truncated at an aperture or spectrally filtered.</p>
<p>The diode driver can also contribute a lot to the laser noise, because even very fast current fluctuations can be transformed into intensity and phase fluctuations of the generated light.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Device Lifetime</h2>
<div>
<p>When operated under proper conditions, diode lasers can be very reliable during lifetimes of tens of thousands of hours.
However, much shorter lifetimes can result from a number of factors, such as operation at too high temperatures (e.g. caused by insufficient cooling) and current or voltage spikes, e.g. from electrostatic discharge or ill-designed laser drivers.</p>
<p>There are different failure modes, including catastrophic <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage</a> (COD) (with complete device destruction within milliseconds or less) and steady degradation.
Apart from the operation conditions, various design factors strongly influence the lifetime.
For example, designs with aluminum-free active regions have been found to have superior reliability and lifetimes, and certain coatings (or just additional semiconductor layers) on optical surface can also be very helpful.
The details of some advanced diode designs have not been disclosed by manufacturers in order to maintain a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>In order to improve device lifetimes, LDs are often operated at reduced current levels (and thus output powers).
Moderate power reductions can at the same time increase the <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a> due to the lower junction voltage, whereas stronger reductions reduce the efficiency.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>Laser diodes are used in a very wide range of <a href="laser_applications.html" title="applications involving laser devices">applications</a>.
The following list gives some important examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-power single-mode LDs with high beam quality are used for data recording and reading on CD-ROMs, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, and <a href="holography.html" title="methods for recording and reconstructing three-dimensional images">holographic</a> data storage media.
Such lasers can operate in different spectral domains from the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> to the <a href="blue_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting blue light">blue and violet</a> region, with the shorter wavelengths allowing for higher recording densities.</li>
<li>Single-mode LDs are widely used in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, particularly in data transmitters.
In some cases, the data modulation is done directly via the drive current.</li>
<li>Single-mode LDs are also applied in <a href="laser_spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of laser light with matter is utilized">laser spectroscopy</a> (TDLAS) with very compact low-power measurement devices.</li>
<li>Small red laser diodes (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="red_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting red light"><em>red lasers</em></a>) are used as <a href="laser_pointers.html" title="devices used for pointing at items with laser beams">laser pointers</a>.</li>
<li><a href="distance_measurements_with_lasers.html" title="measurements of distances using laser light">Distance measurements</a> are often done with modulated low-power diode lasers.
Similar lasers are used in laser printers, scanners and bar code readers.</li>
<li><a href="broad_area_laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes with a strongly asymmetric shape of the emitting region">Broad area laser diodes</a>, <a href="diode_bars.html" title="a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a> and <a href="diode_stacks.html" title="arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power">diode stacks</a> are often used for <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode pumping</a> of <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>.

<li>Some kinds of surgery (e.g. treatment of enlarged prostates) and dermatological therapies can be done with radiation from <a href="diode_bars.html" title="a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a>.</li>
<li>High-power <a href="diode_stacks.html" title="arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power">diode stacks</a> are directly used in material processing in cases where a high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> is not required, e.g. for surface hardening, welding and soldering.
Compared with other <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power lasers</a>, they are simpler and have a much better <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of sales volumes, the applications in optical data storage and telecommunications are very dominating.
The third most important application, which is pumping of solid-state lasers, already has sales volumes which are nearly an order of magnitude lower than the previously mentioned sectors.</p>
<p>Low-power laser diodes generate the largest revenues of all laser types &ndash; mainly due to applications in communications and data storage.
High-power laser diodes have far lower sales numbers and volumes, and are used mainly for displays (with fast growth), <a href="medical_lasers.html" title="laser systems used for medical applications">medical</a> and military applications.
Direct use of high-power laser diodes for material processing his a small volume so far, but exhibits rapid growth.</p>
