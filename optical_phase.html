</header>
<p>Optical radiation is associated with electromagnetic waves, and as other waves those can be characterized with an <em>amplitude</em> and a <em>phase</em>.
The phase determines in which part of an oscillation cycle the electric field is. (For a plane wave propagating in free space, the electric and magnetic field are in phase, i.e., their phase values are identical.)
The phase advances by <span class="eqn_il">2&thinsp;<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span> per oscillation cycle, which means (for optical waves) substantial phase changes within a single femtosecond.
The temporal derivative of the phase determines the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a>.</p>
<p>When an optical wave can be described with a phasor (i.e., a complex amplitude), the optical phase can be associated with the complex phase.
For example, a <a href="plane_waves.html" title="waves with plane wavefronts">plane wave</a> propagating in <span class="eqn_il"><i>z</i></span> direction can be described with a phasor <span class="eqn_il"><i>A</i>&thinsp;exp(<i>i</i>&thinsp;(<i>k&thinsp;z&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;<span class="greek">&omega;</span>&thinsp;t</i>))</span>, where the optical phase is <span class="eqn_il">arg(<i>A</i>)&thinsp;+&thinsp;<i>k&thinsp;z&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;<span class="greek">&omega;</span>&thinsp;t</i></span>.</p>
<p>A high temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> essentially means that the optical phase involves systematically and predictably in time.
Similarly, spatial coherence is related to the correlation between phases at different points in space.
Ideally (i.e., for light with perfect spatial coherence), one has well-defined phase fronts, i.e., surfaces connecting points with equal optical phase.</p>
<p>When light propagates through a transparent medium, its optical phase is delayed in proportion to the propagation distance.
The proportionality factor is called the <em>phase constant</em> (or <a href="wavenumber.html" title="the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;"><em>wavenumber</em></a>), which is the imaginary part of the <a href="propagation_constant.html" title="a mode- and frequency-dependent quantity describing the propagation of light in a medium or waveguide">propagation constant</a> and is related to the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>.
Due to the high optical frequencies, substantial optical phase delays occur already within propagation distances well below a micrometer.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The essential function of an optical element is often to apply some kind of phase changes.</aside>
<p>The essential function of various optical elements is to apply a spatially dependent (but time-independent) optical phase changes (phase shifts) to a light beam.
For example, spherical <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a> apply phase changes which are approximately proportional to the square of the distance from the lens axis.
Deviations from the ideal radial dependence for imaging applications are called <a href="spherical_aberrations.html" title="optical aberrations resulting from spherical optical surfaces">spherical aberrations</a>.
<a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">Diffraction gratings</a> generate phase shifts proportional to a spatial coordinate (implying a change of propagation direction), which also depend on the optical frequency.
<a href="waveplates.html" title="transparent plates with a defined amount of birefringence, used for modifying the polarization of light">Waveplates</a> produce phase changes which are <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a>-dependent.</p>
<p>For applying well-controlled time-dependent phase changes to <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a> &ndash; even including very fast phase modulations &ndash; one can use <a href="phase_modulators.html" title="devices for manipulating the phase of a laser beam">phase modulators</a>.</p>
<p>Due to <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> of optical media, one wave can affect the optical phase of another wave when they overlap in space and time; this effect is called <a href="cross_phase_modulation.html" title="a nonlinear effect where the optical intensity of one beam influences the phase change of another beam">cross-phase modulation</a>.
Also, each beam can modify its own phase (<a href="self_phase_modulation.html" title="nonlinear phase modulation of a beam, caused by its own intensity via the Kerr effect">self-phase modulation</a>).</p>
<p>Many phenomena in optics and photonics are dependent on optical phases or phase differences.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The phase profile of a light beam is essential for its further propagation in space.
For example, curved <a href="wavefronts.html" title="surfaces connecting points with the same phase of a wave">wavefronts</a> are associated with divergence or convergence of a beam.</li>
<li><a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">Interference</a> effects strongly depend on optical phases &ndash; find more details below.</li>
<li>Resonance phenomena &ndash; e.g. in the context of <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonators</a> &ndash; are associated with round-trip phase shifts which are an integer multiple of <span class="eqn_il">2&thinsp;<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>.</li>
<li>For efficiently coupling light into an <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonator</a> one requires <a href="mode_matching.html" title="the precise spatial matching of the electric field distributions of laser beams and resonator modes or waveguide modes">mode matching</a>.
Essentially, that means that the phase fronts of the incident light match those of a resonator <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">mode</a>.</li>
<li>Some nonlinear processes can be efficient only if the <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase matching</a> is achieved.
Essentially, that means that the relative phases of involved optical waves do not change too much during propagation through a nonlinear medium.</li>
<li>The <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> of a laser is determined by fluctuations of the optical phase of its output beam.</li>
</ul>
<p>For optical <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a>, one sometimes specifies a <a href="timing_phase.html" title="a phase reflecting timing deviations by relating them to the pulse period">timing phase</a> related to <a href="timing_jitter.html" title="fluctuations of the temporal positions of pulses">timing jitter</a>; this should not be confused with fluctuations of the optical phase.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Phase of Non-Monochromatic Light</h2>
<div>
<p>The optical phase is clearly defined for <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">quasi-monochromatic</a> waves, but not for waves with very complicated oscillation patterns.
For example, it is not clear how to define the optical phase of broadband light generated as <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">thermal radiation</a> (e.g. light from a <a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">incandescent lamp</a> or sunlight).</p>
<p>Further, the optical phase may have a complicated dependence on the position in a light beam; in a <a href="multimode_beams.html" title="light beams in free space or in transparent media which involve multiple (often many) modes, frequently with highly random characteristics">multimode beam</a>, one may have a different phase evolution for each <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">mode</a>.
<a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">Laser beams</a>, on the other hand, are often close to <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a>, which implies that there is a nearly perfect phase correlation across the whole beam profile.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> from <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a> usually have a clearly defined optical phase, even if they are very broadband.
Normally, the phase is well reproducible from pulse to pulse; a consequence of that is that the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> of such a pulse train consists of discrete lines (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="frequency_combs.html" title="optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines">frequency combs</a>).
A systematic phase change from pulse to pulse, measured relative to the pulse envelope, is called the <a href="carrier_envelope_offset.html" title="the offset between the optical phase and the maximum of the wave envelope of an optical pulse">carrier&ndash;envelope offset</a> phase.
High spatial coherence is normally also obtained.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Phase in Time and Frequency Domain</h2>
<div>
<p>Usually, optical phases are considered in the time domain.
However, one also consider the phases of optical frequency components, i.e., the optical phase in the frequency domain; that is called the <a href="spectral_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field in the frequency domain">spectral phase</a>.
A constant phase change in the time domain corresponds to the same phase change in the frequency domain.
A time delay e.g. of an ultrashort pulse is associated with a change of spectral phase which is <span class="eqn_il">2&thinsp;<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span> times the frequency times the time delay.
In general, modulations of the phase in the time domain lead to a modified optical spectrum, and not just related phase changes in the frequency domain.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Phase Differences in Interference Effects</h2>
<div>
<p>Due to the very high optical frequencies, it is difficult to directly measure optical phases.
However, phase differences are often relevant in the context of <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effects, and those may evolve relatively slowly if the involved waves have similar frequencies.
For example, one can obtain an optical <a href="beat_note.html" title="an oscillation of the optical intensity arising from the superposition of light with different optical frequencies">beat note</a> when superimposing two quasi-<a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> laser beams with similar optical frequencies; one may then measure the beat frequency (e.g. in the megahertz or gigahertz region) with a sufficiently fast <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a>.
Any phase deviation of one of the involved optical beams is directly translated into a phase deviation of the obtained beat signal.</p>
<p>In an <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometer</a>, one often compares the phases of two beams which have been derived from the same laser beam, but where only one of the beams has been affected by a phase change.
One can precisely measure tiny phase differences by converting them into intensity changes of the superimposed beams.</p>
<p>The measurement of optical phase and frequency differences &ndash; usually based on <a href="beat_note.html" title="an oscillation of the optical intensity arising from the superposition of light with different optical frequencies">beat notes</a> &ndash; is a crucial element of <a href="optical_metrology.html" title="the science and technology of performing measurements with light">optical metrology</a>.
Particularly with <a href="frequency_combs.html" title="optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines">frequency combs</a> (generated with <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>), it is nowadays possible to precisely compare optical frequencies, even if they are too far apart for directly measuring beat notes.
Also, precise comparisons with microwave frequencies (e.g. from atomic clocks) are possible, where one can virtually avoid any phase slips, i.e., register and compare those oscillations with a phase accuracy of milliradians or less.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Phase Noise</h2>
<div>
<p>The optical phase e.g. of a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> is always subject to some level of <a href="phase_noise.html" title="noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a>, e.g. due to <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> in the laser gain medium or to length changes in the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.
Therefore, a beat note between two <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency lasers</a> is not a perfectly monochromatic signal, but also exhibits some level of phase noise.
In fact, the phase noise of lasers is often measured by recording such beat notes.</p>
<p>See the article on <a href="phase_noise.html" title="noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Free Tutorial: Modeling of Fiber Amplifiers and Lasers</h2>
<p>We have published a new <a href="./tutorial_modeling.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">tutorial</a> which discusses the modeling of fiber amplifiers and lasers.
It addresses many questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a <a href="./tutorial_modeling1.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">model</a>?</li>
<li>Should one use <a href="./tutorial_modeling3.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">power propagation or field propagation</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate the behavior of <a href="./tutorial_modeling4.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">laser-active ions</a>?</li>
<li>How to calculate <a href="./tutorial_modeling5.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">steady-state solutions</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate <a href="./tutorial_modeling6.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">dynamical behavior</a> and <a href="./tutorial_modeling7.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">ultrashort pulse propagation</a>?</li>
<li>What aspects are important for the <a href="./tutorial_modeling8.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">decision</a> whether to develop own modeling software or use commercial software?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./tutorial_modeling.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">Read the tutorial!</a></p>
