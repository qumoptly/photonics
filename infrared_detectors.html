<p>Infrared detectors are detectors for <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a>.
Some of them are <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> (photon detectors) which are sensitive in a relatively long <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> region, while others are based on sensing small temperature increases induced by <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> of infrared light.</p>
<p>One may in principle also regard <a href="laser_viewing_cards.html" title="cards used for visualizing laser beams in non-visible spectral regions">laser viewing cards</a> as infrared detectors, which however do not deliver a signal, but emit some visible light.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Infrared Photodetectors</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Infrared Photodiodes</h3>
<div>
<p>For the short-wavelength part of the near infrared, ordinary <em>silicon</em> <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> can be used; they are <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> falls off for <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> somewhere between 1&nbsp;&mu;m and 1.1&nbsp;&mu;m, depending on the thickness of the active region.</p>
<p>For longer wavelengths, semiconductor materials with a lower <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a> are required, so that <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a> with lower energy are sufficient to create a carrier which contribute to some <a href="photocurrent.html" title="an electric current which is induced by incident light in a photodetector">photocurrent</a>.
<em>Indium gallium arsenide</em> (InGaAs) detectors are suitable for wavelengths up to &approx;1.7&nbsp;&mu;m.
Similarly, <em>germanium</em> (Ge) photodiodes can be used at &approx;0.9&nbsp;&mu;m to 1.6&nbsp;&mu;m.
For longer wavelengths even beyond 5&nbsp;&mu;m, indium antimonide (InSb) photodiodes are available.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Infrared Photoconductive Detectors</h3>
<div>
<p>Infrared light at wavelengths sometimes beyond 5&nbsp;&mu;m can be detected with <em>lead salt detectors</em>, e.g. containing lead selenide (PbSe) or lead sulfide (PbS).
Such devices are not fabricated with epitaxial growth, as e.g. InGaAs photodiodes, but rather by deposition of thin polycrystalline films.
They are <em>photoconductors</em> (<a href="photoconductive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which exhibit a reduction in electrical resistance caused by incoming light"><em>photoresistors</em></a>), not photodiodes, i.e., they do not contain a p&ndash;n junction but exhibit a reduction in electrical resistance caused by incident light, which induces intraband transitions.
Lead salt detectors can be used at room temperature, although better performance is possible with cooled detectors.
Note that cooling does not only reduce the <a href="dark_current.html" title="a current from a photodetector which occurs even in the absence of a light input">dark current</a> and therefore improve the sensitivity, but also reduces the <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a>, so that light with longer wavelengths can be detected.</p>
<p>Another detector technology, which is widely used, is based on photoresistors containing <em>mercury cadmium telluride</em> (MCT, Hg<sub>x</sub>Cd<sub>1&minus;x</sub>Te).
Through the composition parameter (i.e., the mercury content), the bandgap energy can be tuned in a wide range.
That way, detection at rather long wavelengths (partly beyond 12&nbsp;&mu;m) is possible.
MCT detectors are usually cooled, and they can be made as <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensors</a> (or <a href="focal_plane_arrays.html" title="arrays of light detectors placed in the focal plane of an imaging system">focal plane arrays</a>), which are mostly used for <a href="thermal_imaging.html" title="imaging based on thermal radiation">thermal imaging</a>.</p>
<p>For even longer infrared wavelengths &ndash; even in the far infrared somewhat beyond 200&nbsp;&mu;m wavelength &ndash;, there are highly doped silicon and germanium detectors.
Such long-wave infrared detectors are <em>extrinsic</em> (<em>impurity band</em>) semiconductor devices, i.e., they rely on additional energy levels introduced by impurities like arsenic, copper, gold or indium.
They need to be cooled to very low temperatures (e.g. 4&nbsp;K with liquid helium), because thermal excitation would otherwise mask any infrared light signals. </p>
<p>Another technology is that of <em>quantum well infrared photodetectors</em> (<em>QWIP</em>) based on GaAs/AlGaAs.
They are cooled photoconductive detectors containing multiple quantum wells, Where instead of interband transitions one utilizes transitions involving quantum well bound states and possibly continuum states.
For example, GaAs/AlGaAs-based QWIPs can provide sensitivity around 6&ndash;20&nbsp;&mu;m, but often in a relatively narrow spectral regions (defined by the utilized transitions).
At low operation temperatures of e.g. 50&nbsp;K, they have some advantages over MCT detectors, particularly for the fabrication of imaging detector arrays.
There are also <em>quantum dot infrared photodetectors</em> (<em>QDIP</em>), where one uses <a href="quantum_dots.html" title="microscopic structures confining charge carriers in three dimensions">quantum dots</a> instead of <a href="quantum_wells.html" title="thin layers confining carriers in one dimension">quantum wells</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the infrared detector materials contain hazardous substances like lead, cadmium and mercury.
Therefore, their use is increasingly restricted, e.g. by the European RoHS regulations.
Temporary exceptions, however, are in place for specific applications, where it is difficult to find substitutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Thermal Infrared Detectors</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="thermal_detectors.html" title="light detectors which are based on measuring light-induced temperature rises">Thermal detectors</a> do not directly detect <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>, but rather respond to a temperature increase caused by <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> of incoming infrared light.
They can be based on different technologies:</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Pyroelectric Detectors</h3>
<div>
<p>There are <a href="pyroelectric_detectors.html" title="light detectors based on the pyroelectric effect"><em>pyroelectric detectors</em></a> based on ferroelectric materials such as lithium tantalate, generating a small electric voltage pulse in response to a temperature gradient caused by an incident light pulse.
They can be used e.g. in <a href="optical_energy_meters.html" title="instruments for measuring optical pulse energies">optical energy meters</a> for measuring the <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a> of a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a>, including the pulse-to-pulse fluctuations.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Bolometers</h3>
<div>
<p>A bolometer sensor contains a thin infrared-absorbing plate, made e.g. of amorphous silicon (aSi) or vanadium oxide, which is suspended with two electrodes.
One can then measure the temperature-dependent electrical resistance of the plate.
Note that without incoming infrared light the temperature of the plate will relax towards the heat sink temperature, while incoming radiation will increase the temperature above that of the substrate.
The readings will thus have to be corrected according to the substrate temperature, if that is not held constant.
A metal mirror below the plate may be used to back-reflect non-absorbed infrared light and at the same time to reduce the thermal radiation from the substrate.</p>
<p>Bolometers can also be made in the form of <em>microbolometers</em>, e.g. for use in <a href="infrared_cameras.html" title="cameras which work with infrared light">infrared cameras</a>.</p>
<p>Thermal detectors are often operated at room temperature, i.e., without cooling.
Often, however, they are temperature-stabilized, i.e., the operation temperature is kept constant, typically with a small Peltier cooler, but not at a particularly low temperature.
With cooled operation, one can further improve the performance.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Trade-off between Sensitivity and Bandwidth</h3>
<div>
<p>Thermal detectors are subject to a fundamental trade-off between <a href="sensitivity.html" title="(different meanings, depending on the context)">sensitivity</a> and <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
This can be best understood by considering a rather simplified model, where the absorber, the temperature of which is measured, has a certain heat capacity (which is proportional to its mass) and is thermally connected to the outside world with some thermal resistance.
Ignoring the thermal capacitance of any other things, for example the thermal connection of the absorber to the outside world, one obtains rather simple relations between heating power, induced temperature rise and bandwidth:</p>
<ul>
<li>The temperature rise and thus the measurement signal are proportional to the thermal resistance.
Therefore, a high thermal resistance is beneficial for obtaining a high sensitivity.
Also, it can help to use a rather small absorber, if the incident light can be well focused to it.</li>
<li>On the other hand, there is a thermal time constant which is proportional to the heat capacity and inversely proportional to the thermal resistance.
Therefore, a high thermal resistance will make the detector slow.</li>
<li>Besides, there is a fundamental limitation by thermal noise in the form of temperature fluctuations.
One can show that the standard deviation of the temperature of the absorber is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the square root of the thermal capacitance.
This limitation is most relevant for miniaturized absorbers, as used in microbolometers &ndash; which, however, may in practice still be limited by other noise sources, e.g. those of the temperature sensor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2009_10_19.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
