<h2 class="togglediv">Consulting Services &ndash; An Indispensable Business Tool</h2>
<div>
<p>The use of technical consulting services is quite common e.g. in the United States &ndash; for good reasons.
In Europe, consulting services are very routinely used e.g. for financial aspects (e.g. insurances or investments), for recruiting and controlling, whereas in the technical area there is still a tendency to muddle through without external help.</p>
<p>Here are some general thoughts on technical consulting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consulting services are <i>not a luxury</i> which you can afford only in good times.
Rather you cannot never afford <i>not</i> to use such a cost-effective tool!</li>
<li>The use of consulting services is <i>cost-effective</i>: get the best solutions as you need them, rather than maintaining a large all-purpose infrastructure.
You can basically <i>buy know-how as you need it</i>.</li>
<li>Time and quality matters: imagine the possible extra expenses caused by getting a solution too late or with insufficient quality!
And don't risk to spoil great opportunities by not having done certain things properly in time.
Time to market is a key issue for a successful business.</li>
<li>Your job is not to do everything yourself, but to <i>reach your goals</i>.</li>
<li>You are competent in your area, but nobody can cover all fields.
Example: You may be the best expert on fabricating your products, but can you also cover all competing technologies and all possible application areas?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will recognize that competent consulting services can be used as an invaluable tool for extending and expanding your technical capabilities.</p>
