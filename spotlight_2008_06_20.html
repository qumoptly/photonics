It seems though, that this approach has no real chance to lead to cheaper systems with comparable performance. The article gives some reasons for that opinion.</p>

<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="ultrafast_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting ultrashort pulses">ultrafast lasers</a>, <a href="ultrafast_amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers for ultrashort (femtosecond or picosecond) optical pulses">ultrafast amplifiers</a>, <a href="regenerative_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with a resonator in which a light pulse can do multiple round trips before being coupled out">regenerative amplifiers</a></p>
<p>Some applications e.g. in micromachining can greatly profit from the use of amplified femtosecond or picosecond pulses with <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a> of the order of e.g. 0.1&ndash;1&nbsp;mJ.
In particular, very fine structures can be processed with very high quality and considerable speed.
Unfortunately, the required sources of such pulses are relatively complex and fairly expensive.
Typically, such a system contains a <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a> and a <a href="regenerative_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with a resonator in which a light pulse can do multiple round trips before being coupled out">regenerative amplifier</a>.
Presumably there could be many more applications of such sources if these were simpler and cheaper.</p>
<p>It might seem to be very attractive to develop some kind of &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; <a href="ultrafast_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting ultrashort pulses">ultrafast laser</a> system, which would not contain a separate laser and amplifier, but rather a single device which both generates and amplifies the pulses.
Such kind of ideas have occasionally been pursued in different variants.
For example, one may be tempted to use a <a href="cavity_dumping.html" title="a method for extracting intense short or ultrashort pulses from a laser, using an optical switch in the laser resonator">cavity dumper</a> in such a way that the high pulse energies associated with <a href="q_switching_instabilities.html" title="instabilities of passively mode-locked lasers where the pulse energy is unstable">Q-switching instabilities</a> can be exploited.
Unfortunately, however, such attempts have never resulted in a performance level comparable to that of the straight-forward laser&ndash;amplifier systems as mentioned above.</p>
<p>A closer analysis shows that there is probably no method which can realistically promise to achieve the performance of a regenerative amplifier system while using a single <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> and being significantly less expensive.
One reason is that the requirement of two gain media and two pump sources is not the central economical problem; one also requires e.g. at least one fast modulator (often an <a href="electro_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic modulator</a>) and the corresponding electronics, and beyond the part cost there is a significant cost for the system development, which is a serious issue for the limited sales numbers achievable with such devices.
Sophisticated ideas for all-in-one laser systems can be developed, but the system development is likely to be more tricky and thus more expensive than that of the more modular conventional approach, which allows one to use a separately developed and optimized mode-locked laser on one side and a dedicated amplifier on the other side.
A serious technical problem is that various nasty trade-offs are introduced by using one gain medium for both pulse generation and amplification.</p>
<p>In short, the fact that the conventional laser&ndash;amplifier systems totally dominate the market does not result from a lack of clever ideas for all-in-one systems, but rather from the fact that this approach is simply not very sensible.
Well, it is conceivable of course that I have overlooked some clever possibility.
I would be very surprised, though, to see the <a href="regenerative_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with a resonator in which a light pulse can do multiple round trips before being coupled out">regenerative amplifier</a> technology being replaced with anything else.</p>

<h2>Your Lab is Closed due to the Corona Virus Crisis?</h2>
<p>Time to think how to best utilize your time!</p>
<p>Here is a suggestion: <br> <b>Consider to start with physical modeling!</b></p>

<li>Build models for your existing or planned lasers and amplifiers, resonators, etc.</li>
<li>Utilize such models in order to <b>improve your qualitative and quantitative understanding</b>, solve problems, optimize device performance and <b>develop new ideas</b>.</li>
<li>Power up your home office instead of wasting your time!</li>
