</header>
<p>There are various highly transparent organic polymer materials which can be used as <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">optical materials</a> for a range of applications.
This area is called <em>plastic optics</em> or <em>polymer optics</em>.
Due to their typically amorphous structures, these materials  are also called <em>organic glasses</em>.
In contrast, traditional <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">optical glasses</a> are inorganic glass materials.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Used Materials</h2>
<div>
<p>Plastic optics are usually made from organic materials, with the major chemical constituents being carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
One starts with some kind of monomer substance, which is then subject to polymerization (sometimes in the form of polycondensation): macromolecules are formed by combining the monomers.
The formed macromolecules usually have the form of chains, and those chains may also have additional connections.</p>
<p>Common polymer materials for optical applications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, acrylic)</li>
<li class="ta_left">polycarbonate (PC)</li>
<li class="ta_left">polystyrene</li>
<li class="ta_left">liquid silicone, e.g. in the form of flexible resins</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous trademarks for such materials.</p>
<p>Compared with plastics for other applications, optical plastics must be produced from high-quality pure materials with optimized processes in order to obtain a reasonably good optical properties.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Types of Optical Components</h2>
<div>
<p>Plastic objects are mostly used in the form of common bulk optical components like <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a> (including <a href="microlenses.html" title="optical lenses of particularly small diameter, e.g. below 1 mm">microlenses</a>),  <a href="prisms.html" title="transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prisms</a> and <a href="optical_windows.html" title="flat transparent plates with optical quality, used for protection against the environment">optical windows</a>.
An attractive feature for lenses is that <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric lenses</a> with high <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> can easily be <a href="optical_fabrication.html" title="the fabrication of optical components like lenses, prisms and mirrors">fabricated</a> with molding and embossing processes &ndash; more easily and quickly than with most inorganic glasses.
Even free-form optics can be made relatively easily.
Also, one can make <a href="achromatic_optics.html" title="optical devices or setups with minimized chromatic aberrations">achromatic</a> lenses, including apochromats, as composite lenses.
In addition, it is advantageous that plastic optical components may be fabricated together with their mounts.</p>
<p>Plastic optics are often equipped with coatings for improving the mechanical durability.
For example, ophthalmic glasses are often equipped with coatings based on organically modified silica layers.
<a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">Anti-reflection</a> properties can also be realized, typically with coating designs having four to six layers, e.g. of silica and tantalum pentoxide.
<a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">Dielectric coatings</a> can also be made as thin polymeric films, e.g. some amorphous fluoropolymer.</p>
<p>There are <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic optical fibers</a>, which are e.g. used as <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a> for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> over short distances.
They are often made with a PMMA <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> and a <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">cladding</a> made from silicone resin.</p>
<p>Polymers are also used for some <a href="integrated_optics.html" title="the technology dealing with the construction of photonic integrated circuits">integrated optics</a> the devices, which may contain <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a> and other features.</p>
<p>Sometimes, special properties of polymers are exploited.
For example, there are thermo-optic devices, exploiting the high thermo-optic coefficients of polymers.
In other cases, optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> are utilized.</p>
<p>Significant optical <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> can be obtained simply by stretching a polymer material like polystyrene.
Also, plastic <a href="polarizers.html" title="optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizers</a> can be relatively easily made.
On the other hand, unwanted birefringence effects need to be avoided by careful process control e.g. in molding processes.</p>
<p>There are also micro-optics made from plastic materials.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Typical Properties of Plastic Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>High light <a href="transmittance.html" title="the ratio of transmitted optical power to the incident optical power at some partial transparent object">transmittance</a> is usually obtained throughout the visible spectral region and to a limited extent in the near <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a>.
Often, there are <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> features at &approx;1.7&nbsp;&mu;m due to the first overtones of C-H groups and additional absorption at longer wavelengths.
However, absorption losses can be low in the three telecommunication windows around 850, 1310 and 1550&nbsp;nm.</p>
<p>A primary driver for using plastic objects is the typically lower cost.
This results from simple fabrication processes.
For example, many polymer materials are suitable for molding processes, which are simple and quick and can even deliver <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric</a> surfaces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the optical quality is tentatively lower than that achievable with optical glasses.
Therefore, glasses are still widely used for high-quality optical elements, despite their higher cost.</p>
<aside class="callout red">The high-temperature sensitivity of plastic optics can be a problem!</aside>
<p>The <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive indices</a> of optical polymer materials are typically between 1.4 and 1.7, thus similar to those of typical optical glasses.
However, their temperature dependence is usually much stronger than for glasses (with strongly negative <span class="eqn_il">dn&thinsp;/&thinsp;dT</span>), which is essentially caused by their strong thermal expansion (one to two orders of magnitude stronger than for typical glasses).
Therefore, plastic optics tend to be much more temperature sensitive than glass optics.
They can often suitable only for operation temperatures of up to 60&thinsp;&deg;C, although polycarbonate materials can be used up to 130&thinsp;&deg;C.</p>
<p>The wavelength dependence of the refractive index (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>) of polymers is relatively strong.
This can be a problem, but in some cases the combination of strong dispersion with low refractive index, which is unusual for glasses, can be useful.</p>
<p>Plastics are typically quite soft, i.e., they can relatively easily be deformed or scratched, but also do not break as easily as glasses.
For some applications, very self transparent materials are needed, e.g. liquid silicone.</p>
<p>Most polymers are chemically less robust than glasses; for example, they may absorb water, which changes their properties.</p>
<p>The density of polymers is typically quite low, allowing the fabrication of lightweight components entity devices.</p>
<p>Due to residual absorption and the typically quite low thermal conductivity, polymers are usually not suitable for applications involving high <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> or <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">intensities</a>.
Therefore and because of the limited optical quality, they are not common in <a href="laser_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems used with lasers - either in lasers or for transmitting and manipulating laser light">laser optics</a>.</p>
<p>Polymers can relatively easily be equipped with dyes, for example for use as <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filters</a> based on wavelength-dependent absorption.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Common Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>Plastic lenses are widely used in ophthalmology.
For reading glasses and sunglasses, for example, the low weight and reduced fragility is advantageous in addition to the lower cost.
Intra-ocular lenses and contact lenses are basically always made of polymers.
<a href="eye_protection.html" title="the protection of eyes against laser hazards">Eye protection</a> glasses are often made from polymers with added dyes for spectral filtering.</p>
<p>For mobile devices like smartphones and drones, miniature <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photo cameras</a> are needed which are basically always based on plastic optics, often with small <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric lenses</a>.
There would be no available space for <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objectives</a> with multiple spherical lenses, as are typically used for large photo cameras.
Impressive image quality is nowadays possible with extremely compact and low-costs camera designs.</p>
<p>Similar aspects apply to optical storage devices, e.g. with CD, DVD and blu-ray disks.</p>
<p>Further, various types of light reflectors are often made of plastics, for example for directing the output of <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light emitting diodes</a>.</p>

<h2>Short-term Software Licenses Available</h2>
<p>Do you need simulation software (such as our <a href="./fiberpower.html?banner=rented_software">RP Fiber Power</a>) only during a <b>short-term project</b>?</p>
<p>Or do you want to <b>test such software very thoroughly</b> before fully committing to it?</p>
<p>RP Photonics is now offering a solution: <a href="./software_licenses.html?banner=rented_software">software licenses</a> which are valid for a <b>limited time</b>.</p>
<p>Our conditions are very fair:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay only 5% of the amount for a permanent license for one month.</li>
<li>When switching over to a permanent license directly thereafter, get the already paid money fully deducted!</li>
<li>If you decide for that only later on, still get two thirds deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are confident that you will like our software and finally decide for permanent licenses.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:20px;">Stand up for Science!</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">It is acceptable that some don't know much about photons, biological evolution or global warming.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">But we don't want bigot ignorants to make political decisions and educate our children!</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">For example, <b>global warming</b> is not a matter of political opinion, but a fact. Ruthless profiteers are leading astray millions of uneducated people, seducing them to take utterly irresponsible positions. <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">But we cannot risk catastrophic climate changes!</span> Science tells us it is high time to act. Read, for example, the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/">IPCC Synthesis Report</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold;">Stand up for science (perhaps by joining a <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/">March for Science</a>) &ndash; it's our future!</p>
