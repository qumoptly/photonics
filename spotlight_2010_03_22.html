<p>Abstract: All-in-one concepts, where several functions are integrated into a single component, often look attractive at a first glance. The article shows, however, that moderate advantages often come at a high price. A modular approach is often much more powerful and practical.</p>

<p>Particularly in <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>, we often use different parts for including different functions: a <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> for providing the laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, a <a href="semiconductor_saturable_absorber_mirrors.html" title="saturable semiconductor absorber devices acting as nonlinear mirrors">SESAM</a> for <a href="passive_mode_locking.html" title="a technique of mode locking, based on a saturable absorber inside the laser resonator">passive mode locking</a>, a <a href="prism_pairs.html" title="combinations of two prisms, mostly used for dispersion compensation">prism pair</a> for <a href="dispersion_compensation.html" title="the control of the overall chromatic dispersion of a system by adding optical elements with a suitable amount of dispersion">dispersion compensation</a>, etc.
Sometimes, it is possible to combine two or even more functions in a single part, thus reducing the overall number of parts.
Developments in this direction are often considered a great thing, but this <em>all-in-one approach</em> deserves some critical thought.
Here, I do this for several example cases and also draw some general conclusions.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">SESAMs with Built-in Dispersion Compensation</h2>
<div>
<p>In many <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>, we need some <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a> (most often a <a href="semiconductor_saturable_absorber_mirrors.html" title="saturable semiconductor absorber devices acting as nonlinear mirrors">SESAM</a>) for <a href="passive_mode_locking.html" title="a technique of mode locking, based on a saturable absorber inside the laser resonator">passive mode locking</a> and also something for <a href="dispersion_compensation.html" title="the control of the overall chromatic dispersion of a system by adding optical elements with a suitable amount of dispersion">dispersion compensation</a>.
This triggered the idea to do both with a single device &ndash; a SESAM with built-in dispersion compensation.
The idea looked great, and it was pretty obvious how to realize it.
Such SESAMs have a kind of <a href="dielectric_mirrors.html" title="mirrors consisting of multiple thin layers of different transparent optical materials">dielectric mirror</a> structure (consisting of semiconductor layers), and it is well known that <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> can be engineered into such structures with various methods.
One can, e.g., realize a simple <a href="gires_tournois_interferometers.html" title="linear optical resonators used for introducing chromatic dispersion">Gires&ndash;Tournois interferometer</a> structure, or alternatively a <a href="chirped_mirrors.html" title="Bragg-type dispersive mirrors with a spatial variation of the Bragg wavelength">chirped mirror</a>.
I myself have once been involved in a project using the latter approach, see Paschotta et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 75 (15), 2166 (1999), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.124953">doi:10.1063/1.124953</a>.
However, this concept never really took off, and I can tell you why:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some technical problems and limitations, which can partly be overcome but can at least be nasty in some situations.
Only a limited amount of dispersion can be engineered into a SESAM, and even more so the achievable operation <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> is limited.
Furthermore, dispersive features are often associated with resonances (e.g., in GTI designs) which also effect other parameters such as the modulation depth and saturation fluence.
The laser may then decide to lase in some wavelength region where it avoids the highest losses, but this may not be where you get the desired dispersion.
You may then need an additional intracavity bandpass filter, which brings the component count back to where it was and may have additional unwanted side effects.</li>
<li>An ordinary SESAM already has a number of important parameters such as the <a href="modulation_depth.html" title="a relative modulation amplitude, or (for a saturable absorber) the maximum change in absorption">modulation depth</a>, the <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation fluence</a> and the recovery time, apart from the operation wavelength and <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
When chromatic dispersion is added as another dimension, such a device gets even more specialized: if you want to try out different parameter values, you need to have many more different devices, which is highly inconvenient.
At most for mass fabrication of a product, where you really need one particularly combination of parameters, that concept could be worthwhile to use, but in research or for manufacturing in not very large numbers it is not practical.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">All-in-one Ultrafast Laser Sources</h2>
<div>
<p>As I have already discussed this example case in the <a href="spotlight_2008_06_20.html">The Photonics Spotlight 2008-06-20</a>, I mention it only briefly here.
It is possible in principle to use a kind of all-in-one ultrafast laser source instead of an <a href="regenerative_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with a resonator in which a light pulse can do multiple round trips before being coupled out">regenerative amplifier</a> system, consisting of a <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a>, a <a href="pulse_pickers.html" title="electrically controlled optical switches used for extracting single pulses from a pulse train">pulse picker</a> and the actual <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a>.
It turns out, however, that the performance of such all-in-one devices is severely limited; you never get the <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a> which you easily reach with regenerative amplifiers.
Furthermore, the design of such devices is much more sophisticated, so that the development cost can be expected to be much higher than for the traditional regenerative amplifier approach.
So it is not surprising to me that on the laser market you can hardly find anything like that.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">High-power Lasers vs. MOPAs</h2>
<div>
<p>One often uses a <a href="master_oscillator_power_amplifier.html" title="a laser system consisting of a seed laser and a laser amplifier for boosting the output power">master oscillator power amplifier</a> (MOPA) instead of a conceptually more simple <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power laser</a>.
This approach obviously increases the number of parts, but it is nevertheless often very worthwhile.
For example, it is easier that way to combine high-power operation with various other features such as short <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a> or a narrow emission <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
Also, it is easier for a manufacturer to realize product versions with different power levels just by combining the same laser with different combinations of <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a> stages.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fibers with Multiple Functionalities in Mode-locked Fiber Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>In <a href="mode_locked_fiber_lasers.html" title="ultrafast fiber lasers which are actively or passively mode-locked for generating ultrashort pulses">mode-locked fiber lasers</a>, a single optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> often has quite a few different functionalities, such as providing the <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and possibly also contributing to some artificial <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorption</a> via <a href="nonlinear_polarization_rotation.html" title="the phenomenon that the change in the polarization direction of light in a fiber can depend on the optical intensity">nonlinear polarization rotation</a>.
In other cases, one also exploits some <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearity</a>, the effect of optical <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">bandpass filtering</a> related to the limited <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> or some other effects.
This may look very elegant, but also introduces a lot of limitations.
The device complexity is reduced in some sense, but the operation details actually increase in complexity due to the many constraints.
I believe that quite a few people would be very happy to have all these functions separated, but this is often impossible.
For example, you cannot simply remove the fiber nonlinearity and introduce the wanted amount of nonlinearity separately.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Some General Conclusions</h2>
<div>
<p>The examples have shown that while the complexity of a device may be somewhat reduced by integrating several functions into one part, this often comes at a high price.
Part of this is the increased complexity of the operation details, and also we get additional constraints which can strongly limit the achievable performance.</p>
<p>In practice, one often finds that a modular approach is much more powerful and practical: it gives more performance with a much smaller <a href="laser_development.html" title="the process of developing a laser device">development</a> effort, and more easily allows one to make devices with somewhat modified performance characteristics.</p>
<p>If anyone should invest into all-in-one devices, it will normally be a manufacturer of mass products.
Only for him, the advantages of this approach can be relevant, while the increased development cost may not be so important.
However, there are few real mass products in the laser market, particularly in the area of <a href="ultrafast_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting ultrashort pulses">ultrafast lasers</a>.</p>
<p>And how about researchers &ndash; aren't these expected to explore new concepts?
In principle, they are, but I think that anyone will be well advised to think carefully about the potential and foreseeable limitations of new concepts.
Part of my recipe for success as a researcher was <em>not</em> to do certain things (even if my boss wanted me to do it!) when I could predict that it would not be worthwhile.
And just to have no better idea is of course not a good reason for implementing a bad one.
The right trick is often the following: think again!</p>
