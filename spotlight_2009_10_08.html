<p>Recently, the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to Charles K. Kao, Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith.
In this article, I focus on the pioneering work of Charles K. Kao on low-loss optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, there were already glass fibers which could be used for transmitting light.
However, these fibers exhibited enormous <a href="propagation_losses.html" title="losses of optical energy during propagation of light">propagation losses</a>, so that the transmission distance was limited severely.
Therefore, it appeared to most people that long-distance <a href="optical_data_transmission.html" title="the transmission of information using light beams, e.g. in fibers">optical data transmission</a> with fibers, now called <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, would be clearly not feasible.
After any appreciable distance, the optical power would be attenuated to levels which are too low to detect.
It was well known, of course, that progress on detection techniques would not remedy this situation, since there are rather fundamental limits such as <a href="shot_noise.html" title="quantum-limited intensity noise">shot noise</a>.</p>
<p>Despite these discouraging circumstances, Kao had a closer look at the prospects for reducing propagation losses of fibers.
He realized that the losses of existing fibers were orders of magnitude above the fundamental limit, which is set by <a href="rayleigh_scattering.html" title="scattering of light at scattering centers which are much smaller than the wavelength">Rayleigh scattering</a> at the unavoidable density fluctuations in a glass.
Further, Kao searched for ways to get close to this limit.
It was soon realized that a major issue was to greatly improve the purity of the glass, and that silica would be a rather good candidate material.
These ideas were then taken serious by various people, and work based on them went very well indeed.
Already in 1970, the company Corning developed a <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fiber</a> with a propagation loss of 20&thinsp;dB/km.
This triggered a lot of attention, as not long before that the usual figures were in the region of many thousands of <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a>.
Thereafter, the progress remained rapid, leading to even 100 times lower loss levels around 0.2&thinsp;dB/km (in the 1.5-&mu;m spectral region), which is now close to the fundamental limit.</p>
<p>Nowadays, over a billion kilometers of optical fiber are wound around the globe and are used for transmitting enormous amounts of information very quickly and at amazingly low cost.
Without fiber technology, the Internet could quite certainly not be what it is today.
So there can be no doubt that Kao's work had an enormous impact on technology and on our lives.</p>
<p>The only really sad thing to consider is what this technology is largely used for.
Only a tiny fraction of the transmission capacities is used for purposes which seem worthwhile, such as human exchange, science and technology, education and culture.
A large fraction of all e-mails sent is spam, which does not only annoy us all, but also waists enormous resources.
A lot of criminals utilize the Internet for all sorts of purposes.
Even worse, much of the Internet and television content is on a miserable quality level, not working for but against the progress of human mind and culture.
Of course, I would never see technology itself as evil.
But we should sometimes step back and wonder what really brings us forward: still more of that technology or primarily a better use of it.
Note that it is allowed to ask such questions, even if you live from technology, as I do.</p>
