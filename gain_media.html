<p>Within the context of <a href="laser_physics.html" title="the field of physics dealing with phenomena in lasers">laser physics</a>, a laser gain medium is a medium which can amplify the power of light (typically in the form of a light <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">beam</a>).
Such a gain medium is required in a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> to compensate for the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> losses, and is also called an <em>active laser medium</em>.
It can also be used for application in an optical <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a>.
The term <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> refers to the amount of amplification.</p>
<p>As the gain medium adds energy to the amplified light, it must itself receive some energy through a process called pumping, which may typically involve electrical currents (<em>electrical pumping</em>) or some light inputs (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels"><em>optical pumping</em></a>), typically at a wavelength which is shorter than the signal wavelength.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Types of Laser Gain Media</h2>
<div>
<p>There are a variety of very different gain media; the most common of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain direct <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap</a> semiconductors such as gallium arsenide, indium gallium arsenide or gallium nitride are typically pumped with electrical currents, often in the form of <a href="quantum_wells.html" title="thin layers confining carriers in one dimension">quantum wells</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media"><em>semiconductor lasers</em></a>).</li>
<li>Certain <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> and <a href="laser_crystals_versus_glasses.html">glasses</a> such as Nd:YAG (<a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium-doped</a> yttrium aluminum garnet &rarr;&nbsp;<a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG"><em>YAG lasers</em></a>), Yb:YAG (<a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> YAG), Yb:glass, Er:YAG (<a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium-doped</a> YAG), or <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">Ti:sapphire</a> are used in the form of solid pieces (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media"><em>bulk lasers</em></a>) or <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">optical glass fibers</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers"><em>fiber lasers</em></a>, <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media"><em>fiber amplifiers</em></a>).
These crystals or glasses are doped with some laser-active ions (in most cases trivalent <a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">rare earth ions</a>, sometimes <a href="transition_metal_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which are doped with transition metal ions">transition metal ions</a>) and optically pumped.
Lasers based on such media are sometimes called <a href="doped_insulator_lasers.html" title="lasers with a solid-state gain medium containing a laser-active dopant"><em>doped insulator lasers</em></a>.</li>
<li>There are <a href="ceramic_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which have a ceramic (polycrystalline) microscopic structure">ceramic gain media</a>, which are also normally doped with rare earth ions.</li>
<li>Laser dyes are used in <a href="dye_lasers.html" title="lasers based on liquid or solid dyes as gain media">dye lasers</a>, typically in the form of liquid solutions.</li>
<li><a href="gas_lasers.html" title="lasers with a gas (or plasma) as gain medium">Gas lasers</a> are based on certain gases or gas mixtures, typically pumped with electrical discharges (e.g. in <a href="co2_lasers.html" title="infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules">CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</a> and <a href="excimer_lasers.html" title="lasers where optical amplification occurs in a plasma containing excited dimers (or other molecules) with an anti-binding electronic ground state">excimer lasers</a>).</li>
<li>More exotic gain media are chemical gain media (converting chemical energy to optical energy), nuclear pumped media, and undulators in <a href="free_electron_lasers.html" title="laser devices where light amplification occurs by interaction with fast electrons in an undulator">free electron lasers</a> (transferring energy from a fast electron beam to a light beam).</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared with most crystalline materials, ion-doped glasses usually exhibit much broader <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">amplification bandwidths</a>, allowing for large <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tuning</a> ranges and the generation of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>.
Drawbacks are inferior thermal properties (limiting the achievable output powers) and lower laser <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a>, leading to a higher <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump power</a> and (for passively <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>) to a stronger tendency for <a href="q_switching_instabilities.html" title="instabilities of passively mode-locked lasers where the pulse energy is unstable">Q-switching instabilities</a>.
See the article on <a href="laser_crystals_versus_glasses.html">laser crystals versus glasses</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a> of crystals, ceramics and glasses often has to be carefully optimized.
A high doping density may be desirable for good <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> in a short length, but may lead to energy losses related to quenching processes, e.g. caused by <a href="upconversion.html" title="a process where light can be emitted with photon energies higher than those of the light generating the excitation">upconversion</a> via <a href="clustering.html" title="the tendency e.g. of laser-active ions in laser gain media to form clusters in their host medium">clustering</a> of laser-active ions and energy transport to defects.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Important Physical Effects</h2>
<div>
<p>In most cases, the physical origin of the amplification process is <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a>, where <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a> of the incoming beam trigger the emission of additional photons in a process where e.g. initially excited laser ions enter a state with lower energy.
Here, there is a distinction between <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">four-level and three-level gain media</a>.</p>
<p>A less frequently used amplification process is <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">stimulated Raman scattering</a>, involving the conversion of some higher-energy pump photons into lower-energy laser photons and phonons (related to vibrations e.g. of the crystal lattice).</p>
<p>For high levels of input light powers, the gain of a gain medium <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">saturates</a>, i.e., is reduced.
This naturally follows from the fact that for a finite pump power an amplifier cannot add arbitrary amounts of power to an input beam.
In laser amplifiers, saturation is related to a decrease in population in the upper laser level, caused by stimulated emission.</p>
<p>Thermal effects can occur in gain media, because part of the pump power is converted into heat.
The resulting temperature gradients and also subsequent mechanical stress can cause lensing effects, distorting the amplified beam.
Such effects can spoil the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> of a laser, reduce its efficiency, and sometimes even destroy the gain medium (<em>thermal fracture</em>).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Relevant Physical Properties of Laser Gain Media</h2>
<div>
<p>A great variety of physical properties of a gain medium can be relevant for use in a laser.
The desirable properties include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transition</a> in the desired wavelength region, preferably with the maximum gain occurring in this region</li>
<li>a high transparency of the host medium in this wavelength region</li>
<li>a pump wavelength for which a good pump source is available (in case of an <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">optically pumped</a> laser); efficient pump absorption</li>
<li>a suitable <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>: long enough for <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q-switching</a> applications, short enough if fast modulation of the power is required</li>
<li>a high <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a>, obtained via a low prevalence for <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> effects, <a href="excited_state_absorption.html" title="absorption of light by ions or atoms in an excited electronic state, rather than in the electronic ground state">excited-state absorption</a> and the like, but also possibly by strong enough beneficial effects such as certain <a href="multi_phonon_transitions.html" title="transitions between electronic levels of atoms or ions in solid media, involving the emission of multiple phonons">multi-phonon transitions</a> or <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfers</a></li>
<li>ideally, <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">four-level behavior</a>, because quasi-three-level behavior introduces various additional constraints</li>
<li>robustness and a long lifetime, chemical stability</li>
<li>for <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> gain media: a host medium which is available with good optical quality in the required size, can be cut and polished with good quality (appropriate hardness), allows for high <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping</a> with laser-active ions without <a href="clustering.html" title="the tendency e.g. of laser-active ions in laser gain media to form clusters in their host medium">clustering</a>, is chemically stable (e.g., not hygroscopic), and has a good thermal conductivity and low thermo-optic coefficients (for weak <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> in <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power</a> operation) and high resistance to mechanical stress; optical isotropy can be desirable, but in other cases <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> (reducing thermal <a href="depolarization_loss.html" title="losses of optical power in a laser resonator, caused by depolarization e.g. in a laser crystal">depolarization</a>) and possibly polarization-dependent gain is preferable (see also: <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam"><em>polarization of light</em></a>)</li>
<li>for high <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, low <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump power</a>: a high product of emission <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross section</a> and <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a> (<span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&sigma;</span>&minus;<span class="greek">&tau;</span></span> <em>product</em>)</li>
<li>for low <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> requirements on the pump source: high pump absorption may be helpful</li>
<li>for <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tuning</a>: a large <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a></li>
<li>for ultrashort <a href="pulse_generation.html" title="the generation of light pulses (flashes)">pulse generation</a>: a broad and smoothly shaped gain spectrum; suitable <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearity</a> are also sometimes important</li>
<li>for <a href="passive_mode_locking.html" title="a technique of mode locking, based on a saturable absorber inside the laser resonator">passive mode locking</a> without <a href="q_switching_instabilities.html" title="instabilities of passively mode-locked lasers where the pulse energy is unstable">Q-switching instabilities</a>: high enough laser <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a></li>
<li>for high energy pulse amplification (e.g. in <a href="regenerative_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with a resonator in which a light pulse can do multiple round trips before being coupled out">regenerative amplifiers</a>): a high <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage threshold</a> and not too high <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation fluence</a> of the gain</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in many situations there are partially conflicting requirements.
For example, a very low <a href="quantum_defect.html" title="energy difference between pump and laser photons">quantum defect</a> is not compatible with four-level behavior.
A large <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> typically means that laser <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a> are smaller than ideal, and that the quantum defect cannot be very small.
Disorder in solid-state gain media increases the gain bandwidth, but also reduces the thermal conductivity.
A short pump <a href="absorption_length.html" title="the length of which absorption reduces the optical intensity to 1/e of its initial value">absorption length</a> can be advantageous, but also tends to exacerbate thermal effects.</p>
<p>It is apparent that different situations lead to very different requirements on gain media.
For this reason, a very broad range of gain media will continue to remain important for applications, and making the right choice is essential for constructing lasers with optimum performance.</p>

<h2>Shortages of rare earth materials &ndash; a problem for photonics?</h2>
<p>Photonics heavily depends on the supply of rare earth materials in various areas &ndash; think of <a href="./laser_crystals.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">laser crystals</a>, <a href="./rare_earth_doped_fibers.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">active fibers</a> and <a href="./light_emitting_diodes.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">LEDs</a>, for example.
It is hard to see how such things could be done without rare earth materials.
And those have recently been subject to enormous price increases and were even involved in a trade war.</p>
<p>Is that now a reason for serious concerns in the area of photonics?
Do we need to undertake serious recycling efforts?
Our <a href="./spotlight_2014_06_27.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">Photonics Spotlight article</a> analyzes the situation.</p>
<p>Receiving the <a href="./spotlight.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">Photonics Spotlight</a> via our <a href="./newsletters.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">newsletter</a> might be a good idea &hellip;</p>
