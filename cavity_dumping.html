<p>Cavity dumping is a technique for <a href="pulse_generation.html" title="the generation of light pulses (flashes)">pulse generation</a> which can be combined either with <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a> or with <a href="mode_locking.html" title="a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode locking</a>, or sometimes even with both techniques at the same time.
In any case, the basic idea is to keep the optical losses of the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> as low as possible for some time, so that an intense pulse builds up in the resonator, and then to extract this pulse within about one cavity round-trip time using a kind of optical switch (&ldquo;cavity dumper&rdquo;), such as an <a href="acousto_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the acousto-optic effect">acousto-optic modulator</a> or a <a href="pockels_cells.html" title="electro-optic devices, used for building modulators">Pockels cell</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Cavity Dumping for Nanosecond Pulses</h2>
<div>
<p>Originally, cavity dumping was invented in the context of <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>.
The purpose is to eliminate some basic limitations of <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>.
In particular, it can be disturbing that the <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> achievable with a Q-switched laser increases when the <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a> is increased; this is a consequence of the lower laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> for a lower stored energy in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>.
Also, Q switching with high repetition rates may lead to pulse dropout.</p>
<p>The modification for cavity dumping is essentially that the resonator contains only highly reflecting mirrors (i.e., no partially transmissive <a href="output_couplers.html" title="partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupler</a> mirror), and output coupling is controlled with the <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulator</a> in the resonator.
Typically, this is an <a href="acousto_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the acousto-optic effect">acousto-optic modulator</a>, which is turned on briefly for pulse extraction and then diffracts the intracavity beam into the output (see Figure&nbsp;1).</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/cavity_dumped_laser.png" alt="cavity-dumped laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Schematic setup of a cavity-dumped laser. The acousto-optic modulator (AOM) is turned on only briefly when a pulse is extracted. At other times, the light can circulate in the resonator with low losses.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The pulse formation then works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the modulator is kept in a state where most of the light in the resonator is coupled out, so that lasing cannot occur because the device is below the <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">laser threshold</a>.
The energy provided by the pump source is then largely stored in the gain medium, as in a Q-switched laser.</li>
<li>The modulator is then switched to a state where light circulating in the laser resonator experiences only the small parasitic losses.
As a result, the intracavity power builds up quickly &ndash; typically, within a few hundred resonator round-trip times.
No light is coupled out during that period.</li>
<li>Then, the modulator is again quickly switched into the state where most of the light is coupled out.
The light in the resonator is thus extracted within about one round-trip time.
After that, a new cycle can begin.</li>
</ul>
<p>A notable difference from <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a> is that before generation of the output pulse the energy is stored in the intracavity light field, rather than in the gain medium.
The perhaps most important advantage is that this energy can be extracted within just one round-trip time, independent of the time required for building up the intracavity power.
Therefore, the <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> achievable is more or less determined by the resonator length (provided that the switching time of the modulator is not longer than the resonator round-trip time), and is decoupled from the laser gain.
This means that even for very high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a> of e.g. several megahertz, <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a> of a few nanoseconds are still achievable.
In this regime, a Q-switched laser would generate much longer pulses, or would even not be able to generate one pulse for each intended time slot.
(Pulse dropouts can occur when the Q switch is operated at too high frequencies.)
Similarly, the method can be used for lasers with low-gain materials, where short pulses would be difficult to achieve with Q switching.</p>
<p>For high pulse repetition rates (well above the inverse <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>), a cavity-dumped laser operates particularly stably, since some light always remains in the laser resonator after pulse extraction, and this light can act as a seed for the next pulse.
This is the preferred operation regime.</p>
<p>Although the laser setup for cavity dumping is in principle similar to that for Q switching, the requirements particularly concerning the <a href="q_switches.html" title="optical switches which are typically used for generating nanosecond pulses in lasers">Q switch</a> are different:</p>
<ul>
<li>The switching time should not be longer than the resonator round-trip time, i.e., it should usually not exceed a few nanoseconds (while Q switching works well with much lower switching speeds).
For <a href="acousto_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the acousto-optic effect">acousto-optic modulators</a>, this requires not only that the RF source can be quickly switched, but also that the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> in the modulator is fairly small, since the switching time is limited by the transit time of the acoustic wave through the laser beam.
Unfortunately, a small mode area increases the <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a> in the modulator and may require additional intracavity optics.</li>
<li>The diffraction efficiency should be high, ideally well above 50&#37;, so that most of the light can be extracted within one resonator round-trip.
For that reason, acousto-optic cavity dumpers are often operated with higher RF frequencies of several hundred megahertz, as compared with tens of megahertz for Q switches, and use relatively high RF powers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the energy is stored in the light field rather than in the gain medium, cavity dumping can even be applied to some <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a>, in particular to <a href="vertical_external_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="surface-emitting semiconductor lasers with an external laser resonator">vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers</a> (VECSELs).</p>
<p>From these considerations it follows that cavity dumping is superior to Q switching mainly for high pulse repetition rates, particularly if short pulse durations are required at the same time.
On the other hand, this technique introduces additional constraints e.g. on mode areas and switching speeds.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Cavity Dumping of Ultrashort Pulses</h2>
<div>
<p>Cavity dumping can also be used in <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a> for generating <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> with higher <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a>.
As for nanosecond devices, the resonator losses are kept small for most of the time, so that the circulating pulse can become intense.
When it has reached the maximum intensity (and stable pulse parameters), this intracavity pulse can be coupled out with an optical switch.
The switching speed required is then even higher than for nanosecond devices.
Therefore, an <a href="electro_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic modulator</a> in combination with a <a href="polarizers.html" title="optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizer</a> is usually required.
In addition, the switching must be synchronized with the circulating pulse: a fast <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a> monitors the weak pulses leaking e.g. through a highly reflecting cavity mirror, and the <a href="pockels_cell_drivers.html" title="electronic devices for driving Pockels cells">driver electronics</a> use this signal to fire the optical switch at the right time, so that the switching occurs while the pulse is at the other end of the resonator.
The pulse duration achievable is in that case, of course, not limited by the round-trip time; a long round-trip time can even be beneficial because it reduces the requirements concerning the switching time.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/cavity_dumped_ml_laser.png" alt="cavity-dumped picosecond laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span>

The cavity dumper contains a Pockels cell, a <a href="waveplates.html" title="transparent plates with a defined amount of birefringence, used for modifying the polarization of light">quarter-wave plate</a>, and a <a href="thin_film_polarizers.html" title="optical polarizers based on a multilayer dielectric coating">thin-film polarizer</a> (TFP).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cavity dumping for ultrashort pulses is mostly used with mode-locked <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>, such as <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers</a> or <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium-doped</a> or <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> lasers.
The achieved pulse energy is typically about an order of magnitude higher than with an ordinary mode-locked laser (i.e., typically of the order of 1&nbsp;&mu;J), and the pulse repetition rate can be hundreds of kilohertz or several megahertz.
The average output power of cavity-dumped lasers is usually significantly smaller than for a mode-locked laser without cavity dumper; this is due to the effect of parasitic resonator losses.</p>

</figure>
<p>The <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">design</a> of a cavity-dumped laser, particularly for ultrashort pulse generation, is not a trivial issue.
Apart from the aspect of fast and well synchronized switching, problems can arise e.g. from ringing of the Pockels cell or from the optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearity</a> and <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> introduced by the cavity dumper.
The greatly varying intracavity pulse energy is also not compatible with <a href="soliton_mode_locking.html" title="a mechanism for laser mode locking based on soliton pulses">soliton mode locking</a>.
Therefore, it is usually not advisable to consider a cavity dumper as a simple add-on to an independently designed mode-locked laser.
Instead, the system as whole should be properly designed, taking into account e.g. the effect of the nonlinearity of the cavity dumper on the pulse formation from the very beginning.</p>
<p>For higher pulse energies, lower <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a> may be considered.
However, cavity dumping then no longer works very well: when the intracavity power really vanishes between two extracted pulses, the stability of the process is degraded.
For similar reasons, it is also not easy to combine cavity dumping with mode locking and simultaneous Q switching: whereas Q switching can quickly build up a high power in the resonator, the mode-locking process requires much more time to form stable pulses.
For low repetition rates (e.g. for 10&nbsp;kHz or lower) with correspondingly higher pulse energies, <a href="regenerative_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with a resonator in which a light pulse can do multiple round trips before being coupled out">regenerative amplifiers</a> are preferable, where the pulse formation and the amplification process are decoupled.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Nonlinear Cavity Dumping</h2>
<div>
<p>Whereas all previously discussed techniques for cavity dumping are based on some electrically controlled optical switch, it is also possible to do cavity dumping with a <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear interaction</a> [8,&thinsp;11].
Here, the cavity-dumped laser contains a <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal</a>, which is <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase-matched</a> e.g. for <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">sum frequency generation</a>, and cavity dumping is realized by sending pulses from another laser, which is <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched</a>, into that crystal.
The energy is then extracted in the form of a short pulse at the sum frequency.
The <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> is essentially determined by the duration of the Q-switched input pulse.
Between the pulses, the nonlinear crystal causes only low parasitic losses in the laser resonator, and thus allows the build-up of a high intracavity circulating power.
Note that the circulating intracavity power limits the peak power of the generated pulse, since each output <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> requires one photon from each laser to be converted.</p>
<p>If the pulses could be properly synchronized with the <a href="relaxation_oscillations.html" title="small mutually coupled oscillations of the laser power and laser gain around their steady-state values">relaxation oscillations</a> of the continuously pumped cavity-dumped laser (via a suitable choice of repetition rate), the power efficiency could be enhanced further.
Of course, the principle of nonlinear cavity dumping can also be realized with pulsed pumping or Q switching [11].</p>

<h2>The Transparent Laser</h2>
<p>The dream of each laser developer, and not only of each laser scientist: have a <b>transparent laser</b>, where you can <b>look into any components</b> and see e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>optical intensities</li>
<li>excitation densities of laser-active ions</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and this at any location and time, with arbitrary resolution!</p>
<p>If you had this, finally you could</p>
<ul>
<li>fully understand what goes on in your laser,</li>
<li>quickly identify and fix any problems, and</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">make faster progress <br> while saving a lot of money.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely marvelous, but only a dream?!?</p>
<p>Good news: such transparent lasers can be made!
