<p>Slab lasers represent one class of <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>, where the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> (<a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>) has the form of a slab.
Typically, a laser slab is thin in one dimension, compared with the larger extent in the other two directions.
However, other lasers without a large aspect ratio of the gain medium are sometimes also called slab lasers, simply because their gain medium has a rectangular rather than a circular cross-section.
Such lasers are actually often not very different from <a href="rod_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers with a rod-shaped gain medium">rod lasers</a>, also in terms of <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling</a> (see below).</p>
<p>Slab lasers often use laser crystals with relatively large dimensions, as required for high power operation.
The principle can be realized with different <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> materials, for example with <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG</a>, Yb:YAG or <a href="alexandrite_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers based on alexandrite (Cr<sup>3+</sup>:BeAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) crystals">alexandrite</a>.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="co2_lasers.html" title="infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules">CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</a> with a slab geometry, where the carbon dioxide mixture forms a wide gain sheet between two metallic electrodes.
The laser light may be extracted, e.g., with a hybrid <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>, which is an <a href="unstable_resonators.html" title="optical resonators which are dynamically unstable with respect to transverse beam offsets">unstable resonator</a> in the horizontal direction and a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> resonator in the vertical direction.
The rest of this article considers solid-state slab lasers only.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Face Pumping versus Edge Pumping</h2>
<div>
<p>If only the typical slab lasers with wide aspect ratio are considered, there are essentially two different pumping geometries, as sketched in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/slab_pump_geometries.png" alt="face-pumped versus edge-pumped slab geometry">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Comparison of pumping geometries for slab lasers. A face-pumped slab (left) is often used for lamp-pumped lasers, where both pumping (red arrows) and heat extraction (orange arrows) are done through the large faces. The edge-pumped geometry (right) is better for diode pumping. In both geometries, the laser beam essentially propagates in a direction normal to the figure plane, apart from a possible zig-zag path.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The more traditional face-pumped geometry has been developed for <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">lamp pumping</a>.
Here, the pump light comes from the top and bottom, through a transparent cooling liquid (not shown), which is usually in direct contact with the slab.
Offering a huge area and at the same time a very large angular range, this geometry has very low demands concerning pump beam quality.
However, it requires a relatively large thickness and/or <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a> in order to achieve a reasonably high <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> efficiency.
This is a problem at high power levels (see below).
It also makes it difficult to use <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level gain media</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode pumping</a>, the edge-pumping or transverse-pumping geometry is more suitable.
The higher spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> of high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> (e.g. <a href="diode_bars.html" title="a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a> or <a href="diode_stacks.html" title="arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power">diode stacks</a>) makes it possible to inject all pump light through the relatively narrow edge.
The pump diodes can be placed directly at the slab edge, without any optics in between.
As the large faces do not have to be transparent, a wide range of <a href="laser_cooling_units.html" title="devices used for cooling of high-power lasers">cooling mechanisms</a> can be used, including conductive cooling via metallic heat sinks with internal water channels, keeping the cooling water (with possible contaminants) away from the optical surfaces.
In addition to the practical advantages of cooling and pumping at different positions, this geometry provides a long absorption path along the wide direction and thus allows the use of a very thin slab without compromising the pump absorption efficiency.
It is also possible to reduce the <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a> and to increase the pump intensity, and this makes it much easier to use <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level gain media</a>.
Further improvements of the pump absorption efficiency (and indirectly of pump uniformity) can be obtained with reflecting coatings on the pump sides, having only narrow slits for injecting the pump light.</p>
<p>For edge pumping, there are still two different geometries possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>One can pump the slab in directions perpendicular to the laser beam.
This gives a full separation of optics for pump and signal light; one does not need <a href="dichroic_mirrors.html" title="mirrors with significantly different reflection or transmission properties at two different wavelengths">dichroic</a> elements.
However, a disadvantage is the non-ideal pump intensity distribution (with highest pump intensity at the outer parts of the signal beam, at least in case of a straight beam path rather than a zig-zag path).</li>
<li>Using <a href="dichroic_mirrors.html" title="mirrors with significantly different reflection or transmission properties at two different wavelengths">dichroic</a> optics, one can have the pump beam path along a straight signal beam path.
This allows for a good overlap of pump and signal intensity along the whole device, and only two edges need to be polished and <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coated</a>.</li>
<li>Another aspect is that one may either pump the full vertical range of the slab or only a sheet, so that pump and signal beams do not reach the flat surfaces.
The latter approach requires a higher pump <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, which however is not a problem with high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> as available today.
Advantages are that a higher signal <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> is possible that way, and that the flat sides do not need to be polished.</li>
</ul>
<p>The so-called <em>Innoslab</em> amplifier design, which offers impressive performance in terms of output power, beam quality and <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">efficiency</a>, is based on edge pumping in the longitudinal direction and the above-mentioned sheet pumping, combined with a zig-zag path as shown below in Fig.&nbsp;3.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Power Extraction</h2>
<div>
<p>Power extraction is generally more difficult in slab lasers than in <a href="rod_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers with a rod-shaped gain medium">rod lasers</a> and <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a>, as there is a pronounced asymmetry in terms of both geometry and <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>.
This is particularly the case if the full slab volume is pumped (e.g. for lamp-pumped slabs).
Assuming that the slab is cooled through its large faces, there is a strong thermal lens in the direction perpendicular to these faces, and a much weaker thermal lens in the other direction.
One approach to deal with that is to build a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> with a strongly elliptical mode, adapted to the asymmetric geometric shape and lensing.</p>
<p>A technique for strongly reducing the strong thermal lensing in one direction is to use a <em>zig-zag slab geometry</em>, where the <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> makes a zig-zag path through the gain medium (Figure&nbsp;2), so that the effects of the strong thermal lens in the &ldquo;thin&rdquo; direction are largely averaged out.
Here, the flat surfaces need to be polished for high optical quality, and one must avoid anything (e.g., direct contact with metal surfaces) which could spoil their reflectivity.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/zigzag_slab.png" alt="zig-zag slab geometry">

The laser beam experiences <a href="total_internal_reflection.html" title="the phenomenon that light incident on the boundary between two transparent media is fully reflected if the light is coming from the optical more dense medium and the angle of incidence is sufficiently large">total internal reflection</a> at the slab surfaces, except for the Brewster-angled input and output face.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure class="right" style="width:203px;">
<img src="img/slab_2.png" alt="power extraction in a slab laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Power extraction in a slab laser, using a folded beam path, as seen from the top side.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Instead of using a strongly elliptical beam, it is possible to fold the beam path in the other direction (Figure&nbsp;3).
Note that the two folding mirrors should not be parallel, as this would induce <a href="parasitic_lasing.html" title="unwanted laser operation in a laser or amplifier device">parasitic lasing</a> between these mirrors.
In the vertical direction, the pump radiation may be restricted to a thin slice, and the resonator mode size can be adapted accordingly.</p>
<p>Another approach for power extraction is the use of an <a href="unstable_resonators.html" title="optical resonators which are dynamically unstable with respect to transverse beam offsets"><em>unstable laser resonator</em></a>.
Typically, lasing occurs between two highly reflecting mirrors, and part of the circulating power is coupled out using a scraping mirror.</p>
<p>In most cases, a slab laser will have some regions in the laser crystal where the power can not be extracted.
This issue reduces the <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">power efficiency</a> of the device, and at the same time it makes it more difficult to obtain <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, because the outer regions of a laser mode experience a higher gain than the central regions, where <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">saturation</a> effects are stronger.</p>
<p>Due to the high <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> in the transverse direction, <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> (ASE) and parasitic lasing can be difficult to suppress in high-power slab lasers, particularly those operating with high <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> e.g. for pulse <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplification</a> or for pulse generation with <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Thermal Effects and Power Scaling</h2>
<div>
<p>Slab lasers represent a laser architecture for use at <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high power levels</a>, and thus involve strong thermal effects in the gain medium.
The temperature profile can be relatively flat in the two long dimensions, but a strong temperature gradient exists in the vertical direction (see the figures above) because the heat is extracted from the top and bottom faces.
The zig-zag geometry (see above) causes the effects of this strong gradient to be largely averaged out, but optical distortions arise from residual effects in all directions, particularly from end effects.</p>
<p>The temperature gradient is also associated with thermally induced mechanical stress, which is typically strongest at the left and right sides and may cause fracture of the crystal.
For a high fracture limit in terms of pump or output power, the slab needs to be made as thin as possible while the width and length are increased.
For a face-pumped geometry (see above), this requirement eventually compromises the <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> efficiency.
Edge-pumped slabs are much better in this respect.
It is expected that <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling</a> of edge-pumped <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Yb:YAG</a> slab lasers is possible up to the level of hundreds of kilowatts [11].</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Slab Waveguide Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>A special kind of slab laser is the slab <a href="waveguide_lasers.html" title="lasers with a waveguide structure in the gain medium">waveguide laser</a> [13].
Here, the laser light does not fill the whole slab volume, but propagates only within a thin doped region, surrounded by undoped (transparent) material.
This doped region also serves as a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> in the vertical direction, whereas there is normally no guidance in the other direction.
Such a structure is thus a <a href="planar_waveguides.html" title="waveguide structures guiding light only in one dimension">planar waveguide</a> rather than a channel waveguide.
Pumping is still possible from the top and bottom, e.g. by injecting pump light from high-power laser diodes through narrow slits in an otherwise reflecting <a href="pump_chambers.html" title="a part of a lamp-pumped solid-state laser, containing a laser rod, one or more lamps, reflectors, a cooling arrangement and possibly other parts">pump chamber</a>.
This technology has some sophisticated technical aspects, but may be suitable at least for hundreds of watts of output power with relatively high beam quality.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Competing Architectures</h2>
<div>
<p>The various kinds of slab lasers compete with other laser architectures which are also capable of generating very high power levels.
In particular, <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> can also reach the kilowatt power level while typically offering better beam quality and power efficiency.
These architectures are of course not suitable for lamp pumping, and they place certain restrictions on the gain media.
<a href="rod_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers with a rod-shaped gain medium">Rod lasers</a> compete with slab lasers up to the range of several hundred watts, possibly even a few kilowatts, but probably do not have the potential to reach the region of tens or hundreds of kilowatts.</p>

<h2>Photonics in Times of Trouble for International Trade</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">This <a href="./spotlight_2017_02_17.html?banner=International_trade">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> addresses the current serious concerns about the future of international trade and more generally international cooperation. Some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>German trade surplus</b> deserves attention, but claiming unfair practices without differentiating between different sectors of the economy is just stupid talk.</li>
<li>Already announced changes of US policy constitute a serious threat of beginning <b>trade wars</b>, which could have disastrous consequences.</li>
<li>There are also <b>ruthless attacks on essential values</b>, contributing to a breakdown of cooperation.</li>
<li>If we do not stop these developments in time, we may get into the <b>big crunch</b>.</li>
<li>We must <b>fiercely defend fundamental values</b> as well as <b>international cooperation</b>, because this is the only chance to solve a wide range of serious problems.</li>
</ul>
