<p>Most types of <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> &ndash; e.g. <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a>, <a href="phototransistors.html" title="a type of semiconductor-based photodetector with internal current amplification for higher responsivity">phototransistors</a>, <a href="phototubes.html" title="gas-filled or vacuum tubes which can be used as photodetectors">phototubes</a> and <a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultipliers</a> &ndash; are based on the generation of a photocurrent, i.e., a current which arises in conjunction with the <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> of light.
That can involve somewhat different physical mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>In vacuum tube photodetectors such as phototubes and photomultipliers, one exploits the external <a href="photoelectric_effect.html" title="the emission or excitation of electric carriers related to the absorption of light">photoelectric effect</a>.</li>
<li>In semiconductor-based detectors, one uses the internal photoelectric effect, most often in a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n junction.
There are also <a href="metal_semiconductor_metal_photodetectors.html" title="fast photodetector devices based on metal&ndash;semiconductor (Schottky) contacts">metal&ndash;semiconductor&ndash;metal photodetectors</a>, where a Schottky junction is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, one obtains at most one photoelectron per absorbed <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a>.
Some of the generated carriers may be lost, i.e., not contribute to the photocurrent; that can be quantified with an internal <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a>.
The total quantum efficiency, also taking into account the incomplete absorption in the useful active region of a detector, will generally be lower.
The resulting photocurrent is then</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/pd_response.gif" width="114" height="41" alt="response of a photodiode"></div>
<p>with the quantum efficiency <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&eta;</span></span>, the electron charge <span class="eqn_il"><i>e</i></span> and the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon energy</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>h<span class="greek">&nu;</span></i></span>.
The proportionality factor <span class="eqn_il"><i>S</i></span> between photocurrent and optical power is called the <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a>.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The bias voltage often has little impact on the responsivity.</aside>
<p>The used operation voltage often has only a weak effect on the photocurrent via the quantum efficiency e.g. of a photodiode.
Even in photovoltaic mode, i.e., with zero bias voltage, the quantum efficiency is not much reduced.
Only with some forward voltage, the photocurrent starts to be reduced substantially.</p>
<p>For many detectors, the photocurrent is quite precisely proportional to the incident <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a> or <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">power</a> over several decades, until saturation is reached at a certain level.</p>
<p>In addition to the actual photocurrent, there can be a <a href="dark_current.html" title="a current from a photodetector which occurs even in the absence of a light input">dark current</a>, which is independent of the incident light intensity.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Photocurrent multiplication can lead to substantially improved responsivities.</aside>
<p>Some type of detectors employ a multiplication mechanism for obtaining a substantially enhanced photocurrent.
Such mechanisms are available both for devices based on the external photoelectric effect (<a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultiplier tubes</a>) and others based on the internal photoelectric effect (<a href="avalanche_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with internal signal amplification through an avalanche process">avalanche photodiodes</a>).
For such devices, a multiplication factor can be added to the above equation.
That multiplication factor can strongly depend on the operation voltage.</p>
<p>At sufficiently high optical intensities, as can be reached with <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> of light, one may obtain a photocurrent through <a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">two-photon absorption</a>, even if the photon energy is below the <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap energy</a>.
The photocurrent is then proportional to the <em>square</em> of the incident power.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Conversion to a Voltage</h2>
<div>
<p>A photocurrent is often converted to a voltage which is proportional to the current.
The simplest method for that conversion is to let the photocurrent flow through an electrical resistance.
That method, however, is not ideal, since it introduces a trade-off between responsivity and detector bandwidth.
A better solution is to use a transimpedance amplifier, for example.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Noise of the Photocurrent</h2>
<div>
<p>In an ideal case, a photocurrent would exhibit noise exactly according to the <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a> of the incident light.
That situation can well be approached with some photodiodes, having a high quantum efficiency; they can be used for detecting intensity noise at the <a href="shot_noise.html" title="quantum-limited intensity noise">shot noise</a> level and even below (for <a href="squeezed_states_of_light.html" title="nonclassical states of light with noise below the standard quantum limit in one quadrature component">squeezed states of light</a>).</p>
<p>A reduced quantum efficiency &ndash; resulting for example from incomplete light absorption or the internal loss of carriers &ndash; leads to additional photocurrent noise; essentially, this is due to the random loss of some of the photoelectrons.
Obviously, that problem cannot be solved by photocurrent multiplication, but only with an improved quantum efficiency.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Heating Effects</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout red">Heating by the photocurrent is often substantially stronger than by the absorbed light!</aside>
<p>The photocurrent leads to heating of the photodetector.
The heating power is the photocurrent times the applied bias voltage, in addition to the power resulting from the absorbed light.
For typical bias voltages of e.g. 5&nbsp;V or even 20&nbsp;V, the heating through the photocurrent is substantially stronger than that due to light absorption.
The photocurrent may thus have to be limited for operation with high bias voltage.
Otherwise, the photodetector may be damaged &ndash; for example, by breaking of the semiconductor chip or removing a soldiering connection.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Position Sensing</h2>
<div>
<p>The photocurrent from an ordinary photodetector does not provide information on the position of the incident light.
However, there are position-sensitive photodetectors, where two or more photocurrents are measured, and the current distribution contains spatial information.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2009_10_19.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
