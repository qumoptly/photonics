<p>Abstract: It is discussed why laser diodes, in contrast to active fibers, cannot be made with very small refractive index contrast in order to obtain single-mode guidance in combination with very large mode areas. The key problem arises from the refractive index variations caused by the spatially varying carrier density.</p>

<p>For <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber lasers</a>, it has become the usual practice to employ <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a> with <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> guidance in order to obtain a high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
Essentially, one makes a fiber with a low <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> (NA) such that single-mode guidance is obtained despite the large mode area.
This raises the question why one does not employ that technique to high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> such as <a href="diode_bars.html" title="a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a>.
Couldn't one make semiconductor structures with low <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> contrast, such that single-mode guidance is obtained even for a broad stripe?</p>
<p>At a first glance, one may think that the asymmetry between vertical and horizontal direction is the problem: we need a high NA for the vertical direction, where the waveguide extension is small, and a much smaller NA for the horizontal direction.
This could be done, however.
The real problem is that low-NA <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a>, having a low refractive index contrast, can only work when the refractive index can be controlled with high precision.
This turns out to be not simply an issue of precise semiconductor growth: the refractive index depends not only on the exact material composition (which is subject to some errors, particularly in ternary and quaternary compounds), but also on the carrier density.
As the optical intensity would exhibit significant longitudinal and transverse variations in a single-mode laser, there would also be a refractive index variation, which would affect the waveguiding substantially.
For such reasons, even a laser diode fabricated with perfectly accurate semiconductor growth methods could not work with a very small index contrast.
Therefore, we are forced to use multimode waveguides, and it becomes difficult to enforce single-mode operation under such circumstances.</p>
<p>But why do we then not have such problems in the context of <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>?
After all, these <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain media</a> also exhibit some dependence of the refractive index on the degree of excitation of laser-active ions, and we also have significant longitudinal transverse variations of the excitation density.
A big difference, however, is that the gain per unit length is much smaller than in a laser diode, so that the corresponding refractive index differences are much smaller and thus have a much weaker influence on the waveguiding properties.
Unfortunately, we can not use this insight for modifying laser diodes correspondingly: it would not be desirable to strongly reduce the gain per unit length in that case, not only because we don't like to have very long laser diodes, but also because a high power conversion efficiency requires the operation with a substantial carrier density.</p>
<p>We see that interestingly the limitations of such different laser technologies are very different, and that their understanding requires the consideration of a wide range of aspects.</p>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
