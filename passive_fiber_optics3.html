<h2 class="togglediv">Part 3: Single-mode Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>In the <a href="passive_fiber_optics2.html">previous part</a>, we have seen that depending on its <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> profile and the wavelength, a fiber may guide different numbers of <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>.
It may be only a single guided mode (the LP<sub>01</sub> mode), if the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> and the refractive index contrast are small.
In this regime, the fiber is called a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>.
Higher-order modes like LP<sub>11</sub>, LP<sub>20</sub> etc. then do not exist &ndash; only <a href="cladding_modes.html" title="modes in optical fibers (or other waveguides) which are not restricted to the region around the core">cladding modes</a>, which are not localized around the fiber core.</p>
<p>Note that in most cases light with different polarization states can be guided.
The term &ldquo;single-mode&rdquo; ignores the fact that usually (for radially symmetric index profiles and no <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a>) one actually has two different modes with same intensity profile but orthogonal linear polarization directions.
Any other polarization state can be considered as a linear superposition of these two.
(See also <a href="passive_fiber_optics6.html">part 6 on polarization issues</a>.)</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Condition for Single-mode Guidance</h3>
<div>
<p>For <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index fiber</a> designs, there is a simple criterion for single-mode guidance: the <a href="v_number.html" title="a normalized frequency parameter, which determines the number of modes of a step-index fiber">V number</a> has to be below &asymp;2.405.
The V number is defined as</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/v_number.gif" width="256" height="41" alt="V number"></div>
<aside class="callout red">You need more refined tools to check the single-mode condition for non-step-index profiles!</aside>
<p>where <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span></span> is the vacuum wavelength, <span class="eqn_il"><i>a</i></span> is the radius of the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, and NA is the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>.</p>
<p>For other radial dependencies of the refractive index, or even for non radially symmetric index profiles, the single-mode condition normally has to be calculated numerically.
It would <em>not</em> be correct to use the criterion <span class="eqn_il"><i>V&thinsp;&lt;</i>&thinsp;2.405</span>, e.g. with <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i></span> calculated from the maximum index difference.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Influence of the Core Size</h3>
<div>
<p>Generally, one might expect that a smaller core implies a smaller fiber mode.
For a constant <a href="v_number.html" title="a normalized frequency parameter, which determines the number of modes of a step-index fiber"><em>V</em> number</a>, this is true; the index contrast is then getting smaller for a larger core.
However, if we keep the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> constant, the <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i></span> number changes with the core radius, and the mode radius shows a non-monotonic dependence on the core radius, as can be seen in Figure&nbsp;2 for an NA of 0.1:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/mode_size_vs_core_size_01.png" alt="mode size vs. core size">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Dependence of mode radius on the core radius for a constant numerical aperture of 0.12.
The mode radius is defined via the second moment of the intensity profile (D4&sigma; value).
The single-mode regime is left of the gray vertical line.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One can see that for core radii below &asymp;4.8&nbsp;&mu;m, where the V number gets rather small, the mode radius <em>increases</em>.
In the regime of small V values, the mode extends far beyond the core, and it deviates substantially from a Gaussian shape.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;3 shows the same for a higher NA of 0.3:</p>

</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Example: a Typical Single-mode Fiber</h3>
<div>
<p>A typical kind of single-mode fiber for 1.5&nbsp;&mu;m wavelength may have a <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index</a> profile with a <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> radius of 4&nbsp;&mu;m and a <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> of 0.12.
The guided mode then has a mode radius of 5.1&nbsp;&mu;m and an <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> of 75&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>.
That is not too far from the data of the often used SMF-28 <a href="telecom_fibers.html" title="optical fibers for use in optical fiber communications">telecom fiber</a> from Corning.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/bp_in_sm_fiber1.png" alt="intensity profile of LP01 mode">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Radial intensity profile of the LP<sub>01</sub> mode of a single-mode fiber.
The dotted curve shows a Gaussian profile, which is very similar.
The gray vertical lines show the position of the core/cladding boundary.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As is typical for single-mode fibers, the field distribution extends significantly beyond the core; only 54.4&#37; of the power propagates in the core.
(It may seem according to Figure&nbsp;3 that it is more, but note the factor <span class="eqn_il"><i>r</i></span> in the area integral, which makes the outer parts of the profile more important.)
However, the intensity drops quickly with increasing radial coordinate.
The intensity profile is close to a Gaussian profile.</p>
<p>When we decrease the wavelength, we find that the fiber is no more single-mode below the <em>cut-off wavelength</em> of 1254&nbsp;nm: in addition to the LP<sub>01</sub> mode, it then also supports LP<sub>11</sub> modes (actually two of these with orthogonal orientation).
Below 787&nbsp;nm, the LP<sub>02</sub> mode comes in additionally.</p>
<p>In principle, the fiber stays single-mode for any wavelength above the LP<sub>11</sub> cut-off, which is 1254&nbsp;nm.
However, for longer wavelengths the mode becomes larger and larger, and it will become increasingly sensitive to <a href="bend_losses.html" title="propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">bend losses</a>, resulting both from macroscopic bending and from microscopic imperfections.
For the design discussed here, another problem is actually more serious: beyond &asymp;2&nbsp;&mu;m, absorption of the base material (<a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica</a>) sets in.
So in practice there is a limited wavelength interval into which a single-mode fiber can be used.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Launching Light into a Single-mode Fiber</h2>
<div>
<p>Efficiently launching light into a single fiber modes requires that the complex amplitude profile of the incident light (assuming <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> light) has a high overlap with the corresponding mode amplitude profile.
Fortunately, the fundamental mode of a single-mode fiber has in most cases a profile which is close to that of a <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a> (for robust guiding, with large enough <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i></span> value), and Gaussian beams are well approximated by the outputs of most <a href="single_mode_operation.html" title="operation of a laser on axial (longitudinal) resonator modes only, or even on a single axial mode">single-mode</a> <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>.
So the remaining task is</p>
<ul>
<li>to properly focus a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> such that the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> is close to that of the fiber mode,</li>
<li>to place the fiber end at the beam focus (beam waist), and</li>
<li>to align the fiber such that the beam focus hits the fiber core with proper orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, the position error of the incident beam should be small compared with the mode radius.
The following formula tells how the launch efficiency (disregarding possible reflections of the interface) depends on the position error <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&Delta;</span><i>x</i></span> and also on possible deviations between the input beam radius <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>1</sub></span> and the mode radius <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>2</sub></span>, if we can assume Gaussian mode profiles:</p>
<aside class="callout red">Caution: For non-Gaussian mode profiles, you need more refined tools for calculating the launch efficiency &ndash; for example, our <a href="rp_fiber_calculator.html"><b>RP Fiber Calculator PRO</b></a> software.</aside>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/eta_wdx.gif" width="221" height="62" alt="coupling efficiency for single-mode fibers"></div>
<p>We see that for a perfect beam size, an offset of one beam radius reduces the coupling efficiency already to <span class="eqn_il">1&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>e</i></span> &asymp; 37&#37;, and a 5 times smaller error allows for a 90&#37; coupling efficiency.
Note that the equation holds only for Gaussian profiles, but in most cases this is a good approximation.</p>
<p>The beam direction also has to be correct.
This is not so sensitive, however, for typical single-mode fibers.
The angle error should be well below the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, but that is relatively large for small more areas.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">The Effect of Imperfect Launch Conditions</h2>
<div>
<p>What happens, for example, if we somewhat misalign the input beam?</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;2 shows a simulated example, where the input laser beam is displaced by 1/10 of the beam radius.
After some propagation length, only light in the guided mode remains.
All other light is lost in the <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">cladding</a>.
(The cladding/coating interface is often quite lossy.)
At the end of a 10&nbsp;cm long fiber, for example, one will find only light in the core, having a profile which is only determined by the mode profile.
The launch conditions influence only the launched power, but not the output beam profile.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/sm_and_mm_fiber1.png" alt="single-mode regime">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span>

The numerical simulation has been done with the software <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 class="togglediv">Obtaining Large Mode Areas</h3>
<div>
<p>For some applications, it is desirable to have rather large mode areas while still having single-mode guidance.
For example, one may want to minimize <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear effects</a> or maximize the amount of stored energy in pulsed <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a> while preserving a high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.</p>
<p>In principle, it is easy to obtain single-mode guidance even for a rather large core: one only has to reduce the index contrast (thus the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>).
For example, one could increase the core radius in the above example fivefold to 20&nbsp;&mu;m.
If we reduce the numerical aperture by the same factor to 0.024, we still obtain single-mode guidance &ndash; now with an active area of 1869&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>, which is 5<sup>2</sup> = 25 times larger than before.
Unfortunately, however, that brings with it some trouble:</p>
<ul>
<li>As the index contrast is now extremely weak (0.0002), the fiber becomes extremely sensitive to small random index changes resulting from not perfectly controlled fabrication conditions.
The NA of 0.024 is considered impractically small for currently available technology.</li>
<li>Even if a perfect fiber is made based on that design, it will be very sensitive to bending.
Figure&nbsp;2 shows a numerical simulation, where the inverse bend radius grows linearly along the fiber.
On the right side, a bend radius of 1&nbsp;m is reached.
Before that happens, the light experiences serious bend loss.
This means that the fiber could be used only if it were essentially kept straight, and if any significant microbends could be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="img/bp_in_sm_lma_fiber2.png" alt="bending of a large mode area step-index fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;5:</span> 
Amplitude profile in a large mode area fiber, which is bent more and more strongly towards the right side (where a bend radius of 1&nbsp;m is reached).
On the right side, serious bend losses occur.
It is assumed that the <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">fiber cladding</a> radius is 125&nbsp;&mu;m, and that light is fully reflected at that outer interface.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>More advanced fiber designs have been developed, where mode areas well above 1000&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> can be obtained in combination with better bending properties and lower sensitivity to fabrication errors.
However, the described problems cannot be fully avoided.
The fundamental problem is that a very large mode is necessarily only weakly guided, and thus sensitive to various additional effects.</p>
<p>Efficient launching light into a large mode area single-mode fiber is simpler than for a small area, as far as the position alignment is concerned.
Note, however, that as the beam divergence gets smaller, the angular alignment becomes more sensitive.</p>
