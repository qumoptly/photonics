<p>Optical attenuators are devices which can be used to attenuate a light beam, i.e., to reduce its <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
The amount of attenuation is often specified in terms of an <a href="optical_density.html" title="a logarithmic measure of the power attenuation, or the refractive index">optical density</a> or in <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a>, sometimes in percent of transmitted or blocked optical power.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Typical Requirements</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, a fixed degree of attenuation (e.g., 10 <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a>) is sufficient, whereas in other cases one needs a <a href="variable_optical_attenuators.html" title="optical attenuators with a variable degree of attenuation">variable optical attenuator</a> (VOA), where the degree of attenuation can be adjusted, for example manually using some knob.
An intermediate solution is to have a stepwise variable attenuation.
In some cases, the adjustment of the attenuation can be controlled with an electronic signal.
If this adjustment can be made quite fast, the device is actually an <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulator</a>.
(Of course, any optical <a href="intensity_modulators.html" title="devices which can be used to modulate the intensity (power) of a light beam">intensity modulator</a> could be regarded as a variable attenuator.)</li>
<li>It is often essential that the power can be attenuated without affecting the transverse beam profile.
This is the case, for example, when a high-power laser beam needs to be characterized with a <a href="beam_profilers.html" title="devices for measuring the intensity profile of a laser beam">beam profiler</a> which can handle only a limited amount of optical power.
Obviously, it would be a problem if the beam profile would be distorted by the attenuator.</li>
<li>Another aspect is the wavelength dependence.
Often, one needs an approximately constant amount of attenuation in a certain wavelength range &ndash; for example, for all visible light.
There are so-called <a href="neutral_density_filters.html" title="optical attenuators with an approximately constant attenuation in a substantial wavelength range">neutral density filters</a> which are made for such purposes.</li>
<li>For some applications, it is vital that the obtained optical losses are not dependent on the <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a>, or more precisely, that the polarization-dependent loss is very low.
In other cases, for example when working with linearly polarized laser beams, that dependence may not be relevant.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">The limited power handling capability of some optical attenuators can be a problem.</aside>
<ul>
<li>Particularly when working with <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power laser</a> beams, the power handling capability of an attenuator may be another important aspect.
It may be relevant not only to safely avoid damage of the attenuator, but also detrimental effects on the attenuated beam, such as beam distortions, or thermally induced changes of the degree of attenuation.</li>
<li>Many optical attenuators are applicable to free-space beams, whereas others are of fiber-optic type or work for <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a> of other kinds.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Different Types of Optical Attenuators</h2>
<div>
<p>Because the requirements can be very different for different applications, as shown above, a wide range of different kinds of optical attenuators is used in practice, which can exploit different physical mechanisms.
The most important types are explained in the following.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Absorbing Filters</h3>
<div>
<p>Optical <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> is one of the possibilities for realizing optical attenuation.
One can obtain it, for example, in doped <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">glasses</a>, where the type and <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">concentration</a> of the dopant can be used to control the amount of absorption in a certain wavelength range.
Typically, one uses such kind of absorbing filters in the form of plates.
Several of such plates can be used in series in order to realize a higher degree of attenuation.
By removing or exchanging some of the filters, one can realize a stepwise variable attenuation.</p>
<p>Continuously variable attenuation can be realized with a filter wheel (optical attenuator wheel), where the amount of absorption varies along a circle around the axis of rotation.
There are also variable attenuators which are translated linearly by some suitable mechanics.
In any case, the attenuation may be somewhat variable within the area of a light beam.
That effect is avoided in devices where the attenuation varies in steps.</p>
<p>In order to avoid <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effects and problems with back reflections, one often slightly tilts such plates against the incoming beam.</p>
<p>When working with intense laser <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a>, the absorption of a filter may be saturated (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorbers</a>) for some time during and after the pulse.
This effect has to be taken into account; in some cases, it makes absorbing filters unusable.</p>
<p>Using absorbing filters can be a convenient and low-cost approach, requiring little space and introducing essentially no polarization dependence.
However, as the removed optical power is converted into heat, thermal effects will occur at high power levels.
These can easily lead to distortions of the beam profile or even to damage of the attenuator.</p>
<p><a href="neutral_density_filters.html" title="optical attenuators with an approximately constant attenuation in a substantial wavelength range">Neutral density filters</a> can also be made as absorbing filters by using an appropriate combination of dopants to cover a wide wavelength range.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Attenuators Based on Reflection</h3>
<div>
<p>Any uncoated surface of a transparent <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">material</a> exhibits some amount of <a href="fresnel_reflections.html" title="light reflections at optical interfaces">Fresnel reflection</a>, which may be exploited for attenuation.
Often, one uses a reflected beam, carrying a few percent of the incoming power.
When using a plate with parallel surfaces, problems can result from the fact that reflections occur at both surfaces.
It may then be necessary to operate such a plate at a sufficiently large angle of incidence, so that the two reflected beams are clearly separated from each other.
Alternatively, one may use a device with nonparallel surfaces, such as a <a href="prisms.html" title="transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prism</a>.</p>
<p><a href="neutral_density_filters.html" title="optical attenuators with an approximately constant attenuation in a substantial wavelength range">Neutral density filters</a> can also work based on reflecting surfaces in order to make them usable for higher optical powers than devices based on absorption.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Working near Brewster's angle can provide a high attenuation in a single reflection, but may easily lead to problems due to the very strong polarization dependence of the loss.</aside>
<p>The larger the angle of incidence is, the stronger is the polarization dependence of the reflectivity of the surface (as can be calculated with <a href="fresnel_equations.html" title="equations for the amplitude coefficients of transmission and reflection at the interface between two transparent homogeneous media">Fresnel equations</a>).
This dependence becomes extreme when trying to obtain a strong attenuation by using a p-polarized beam with an angle of incidence near <a href="brewsters_angle.html" title="an angle of incidence at which there is no reflection of p-polarized light at an uncoated optical surface">Brewster's angle</a>.
As the reflectivity for s-polarized light is then far higher, the reflected light may actually be dominated by some small unwanted content of s-polarized light in the input beam.
Therefore, this approach is often not suitable.
A more reliable way of getting strong attenuation without a strong polarization dependence is to use multiple reflections at small angles in sequence, even though this may require more optical elements and more alignment.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Dielectric coatings with a high reflectivity are also often not well suitable for attenuating a light beam.</aside>
<p>Another possibility is to use a <a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">dielectric coating</a> to modify the reflectivity of the surface.
By using a relatively highly reflecting coating, one can obtain a high degree of attenuation for the transmitted light.
However, it is again not advisable to use a very high reflectivity (e.g., well above 99&#37;) for obtaining strong attenuation, because the small transmissivity of the coating may then exhibit substantial spatial variations, which can lead to inconsistent attenuation and also to beam distortions.
Therefore, strong attenuation is better realized by a combination of several such filters.</p>
<p>In principle, a variable attenuation is possible by varying the angle of incidence.
Even for filters working in transmission, however, this will lead to a variable transverse beam offset, which may often not be acceptable.
A solution can be to use two such filters in sequence, where the rotation angles are coordinated by some precision mechanics such that no variable transverse beam offset occurs after the device.
A substantial polarization dependence of the attenuation can hardly be avoided with that approach, except with a second pair of such plates.</p>
<p>For the non-used output beam of an attenuator based on reflection, one often requires a <a href="beam_dumps.html" title="devices for blocking and absorbing light beams">beam dump</a> for reasons of eye safety or for avoiding disturbing effects in the device.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Attenuators Based on Polarization</h3>
<div>
<p>Particularly for linearly polarized beams, variable attenuation is often obtained based on polarization.
The most common approach is to use a &lambda;/2 <a href="waveplates.html" title="transparent plates with a defined amount of birefringence, used for modifying the polarization of light">waveplate</a> in combination with a <a href="polarizers.html" title="optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizer</a>.
By rotating the waveplate around the beam axis, the direction of polarization and therefore the degree of attenuation at the polarizer can be varied.
Using a suitable type of polarizer, this principle can be realized at very high power levels.
The power of the rejected beam is then sent into a robust beam dump.
For unpolarized beams and particularly for beams with an unspecified polarization state, such attenuator devices are more difficult to realize.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Fiber-optic Attenuators</h3>
<div>
<p>Various types of optical attenuators can be used in the context of <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a> &ndash; for example, in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>.</p>
<p>In some of these devices, the light from the fiber is transferred into a <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated</a> free-space beam, sent through some bulk optical attenuator, and then launched into the output fiber.
In other cases, attenuation is done purely within fiber devices, i.e., not involving free-space beams.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Many different physical principles can be used for realizing fiber-optic attenuators.</aside>
<p>One possibility for using pure fiber optics is to use a <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber coupler</a>, where some of the power is not sent to the used output port, but to another port.
Another possibility is to exploit variable coupling losses, which are influenced by variable positioning of a fiber end.
For example, one may vary the transverse position of the output fiber or the width of an air gap between two fibers, obtaining a variable loss without a strong wavelength dependence.
(This principle works best for <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>.)
There are also fiber-optic attenuators based on some piece of doped fiber, exhibiting absorption within a certain wavelength range.</p>
<p>Various other physical principles can be used for obtaining variable attenuation with optical fibers.
For example, one may exploit <a href="bend_losses.html" title="propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">bend losses</a> or losses associated with evanescent waves, e.g. at <a href="tapered_fibers.html" title="optical fibers which are over some length stretched out to a very small diameter">tapered fibers</a>.
The choice of method should depend on the detailed requirements of a certain application.</p>
<p>Some fiber optic attenuators are equipped with connectorized fibers, i.e., <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber cables</a> ending with <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a>.
Others are integrated into fiber connectors.</p>
<p>In case of <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, the attenuator should normally work such that the degree of attenuation is not significantly dependent on the propagation mode.
This is often achieved by using bulk elements (see above) for the attenuation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Quantum Noise Effects</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">On the quantum level, the effects of optical attenuators are not trivial to understand.</aside>
<p>On a macroscopic level, the function of an optical attenuator is simply to reduce the optical power of the light beam by a certain factor.
On a microscopic level, however, additional non-trivial details come into play.
In a simplified picture, a linear optical attenuator removes some of the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a> from a beam, where the probability of removal is equal for each incoming photon.
The involved randomness implies that additional <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a> is introduced.
For that reason, the <a href="signal_to_noise_ratio.html" title="the ratio of signal power to noise power in a detector">signal-to-noise ratio</a> of optical measurements can be degraded as a result of attenuation, and that effect can generally not be undone by subsequent optical amplification in some kind of optical <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a>, even if that amplifier would not introduce any excess noise.</p>
