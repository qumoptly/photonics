</header>
<p>The microscope objective is a key component for reaching high performance of a <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscope</a>.
It is the part which is placed next to the observed object, usually in a fairly small distance of a few millimeters.
Usually, the microscope objective produces an intermediate image in the microscope, which is then further magnified with an eyepiece (<a href="ocular_lenses.html" title="lenses or lens systems as used in telescopes and microscopes, for example, close to the observing eye">ocular lens</a>).
Particularly in cases with high <a href="magnification.html" title="the enlargements of images">magnification</a>, most of the magnification is provided by the objective.</p>
<p>Most microscopes objectives are based on <a href="refraction.html" title="the change of the propagation direction when a wave comes from one medium into another one">refractive</a> optics, containing several <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>.
For example, a simple low-NA objective may contain a meniscus lens and an achromat.
A high-NA objective typically contains a more complicated combination of various types of lenses of hemispherical, meniscus, achromatic doublet and triplet type.</p>
<p>There are also reflective objectives, containing curved <a href="mirrors.html" title="devices which reflect light">mirrors</a> and no lenses.
They are naturally achromatic and may be advantageous for operation in extreme wavelength domains.
Also, they can exhibit lower losses of optical power.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Magnification</h2>
<div>
<p>Microscopes often contain multiple objectives on a rotatable nosepiece, for example a scanning lens with only 4&thinsp;&times; <a href="magnification.html" title="the enlargements of images">magnification</a>, an intermediate one (the small objective lens) with 10&thinsp;&times; and a high-resolution large objective with 40&thinsp;&times; or 100&thinsp;&times; magnification.
The eye piece may contribute another factor 5 or 10 in magnification, for example.</p>
<p>Note that a large magnification alone is not helpful if it only makes images larger without increasing the level of detail; see below the section on the numerical aperture.</p>
<p>There are also often color-coded rings indicating different magnification values, e.g. black for 1&thinsp;&times;, yellow for 4&thinsp;&times;, green for 10&thinsp;&times;, etc.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Focal Length</h2>
<div>
<p>The <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a> of a microscope objective is typically between 2&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm.
However, that parameter is often considered as less important, since magnification and numerical aperture are sufficient for quantifying the essential performance in a microscope.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Numerical Aperture</h2>
<div>
<p>The higher the magnification, the higher is also the required <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, because this is the factor which ultimately limits the achievable image resolution.
There are different ways of calculating the image resolution and are slightly different circumstances, but they lead to similar resolution values, which are roughly <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span>&thinsp;/&thinsp;(2&thinsp;NA)</span>, where <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span></span> is the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> (about 400 to 700&nbsp;nm) and NA is the numerical aperture.
For example, an NA of 1 allows for an image resolution of roughly 250&nbsp;nm for green light.
For low magnification, an NA of 0.1 may be fully sufficient.</p>
<p>The highest numerical apertures achievable with dry objectives, operated with air between the objective and the object, are approximately 0.95.
Substantially higher values of e.g. 1.5 or even higher can be achieved with <em>immersion objectives</em>, where the gap between the object and the objective is filled with a liquid &ndash; water or some immersion oil with a higher <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>, often somewhat above 1.5.
Optimized immersion oils do not only have a high refractive index, but also a suitable viscosity and a low tendency for producing stains on the surfaces.
They can be left on an objective over longer times without damaging it.</p>
<p>Note that oil immersion may not work properly e.g. when observing a biological sample in an aqueous solution and the oil is only between the cover slip and the objective.
One may have to use special water immersion objectives for such cases.</p>
<p>Optimal illumination may also require oil immersion on that side.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Image Correction</h2>
<div>
<p>Particularly for objectives with high <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, a high image quality can be achieved only with substantial efforts for correcting various kinds of <a href="optical_aberrations.html" title="degradations of optical images caused in imaging instruments">optical aberrations</a> such as <a href="spherical_aberrations.html" title="optical aberrations resulting from spherical optical surfaces">spherical</a>, <a href="astigmatism.html" title="a kind of optical aberrations; alternatively, a defect of optical lenses or a property of laser beams">astigmatism</a>, coma, field curvature, image distortion and <a href="chromatic_aberrations.html" title="image distortions caused by wavelength-dependent optical effects">chromatic aberrations</a>.
For example, plan-apochromatic objectives, having particularly sophisticated designs, provide optimum flat field correction combined with good achromatic properties.</p>
<p><a href="chromatic_aberrations.html" title="image distortions caused by wavelength-dependent optical effects">Chromatic aberrations</a> essentially result from the wavelength dependence of <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a>.
They lead to colored image distortions.
For conventional microscopy, they can be quite relevant, in contrast to other types of optical microscopy, e.g. certain types of <a href="laser_microscopy.html" title="a technique for generating microscopic images by scanning objects with a laser">laser microscopy</a>.
Best suppression of chromatic aberrations is achieved with apochromatic objectives.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Don't forget the influence of the cover slip!</aside>
<p>At least for high magnifications, the influence of a cover slip in terms of chromatic and spherical aberrations can be quite important.
Therefore, objectives for use in fields like biology, where cover slips are often needed, are designed with integrated cover slip correction.
The correction is often done for a standard slip thickness of 170&nbsp;&mu;m.
A deviation of only 10&nbsp;&mu;m can already be quite problematic for an objective with a high NA of e.g. 0.95.
Some objectives allow the adjustment of the corrected cover slip thickness.</p>
<p>Note that some microscope designs count on the correction of some residual aberrations of the objective by the <a href="ocular_lenses.html" title="lenses or lens systems as used in telescopes and microscopes, for example, close to the observing eye">ocular lens</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, perfect solutions are not available; therefore, one has to accept certain trade-offs, which lead to different optimized solutions for different applications.
For example, optimum flat field properties are most important for measurement microscopes; one may then tolerate somewhat larger chromatic aberrations.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Finite-corrected and Infinity-corrected Microscope Objectives</h2>
<div>
<p>Older microscopes usually require <em>finite-corrected objectives</em>.
Here, the object is supposed to be placed a little below the front <a href="focal_points_and_focal_planes.html" title="points to which parallel input rays are concentrated by an optical system, and the planes going through those points">focal plane</a> of the objective, and the intermediate image occurs at a finite distance of e.g. 160&nbsp;mm from the objective.
Such an objective is designed for minimum image distortions in that configuration.</p>
<p>Finite-corrected objectives are always designed for a certain tube length, e.g. according to DIN or JIS standard (which differ by 10&nbsp;mm in tube length).
Using an objective of the wrong standard may significantly deteriorate the obtained image quality.</p>
<p>Modern microscopes mostly require <em>infinity-corrected objectives</em>, where the intermediate image of the objective alone lies at infinite distance.
Here, one requires an additional tube lens in the microscope for generating the intermediate image at the <a href="diaphragms.html" title="circular (or approximately circular) openings through which light can travel">diaphragm</a> of the eyepiece.</p>
<p>The article on <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscopes</a> explains the advantages of microscope designs based on infinity-corrected objectives.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Wavelength Range</h2>
<div>
<p>Optical microscopes usually work based on <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> with visible light, i.e., in the <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> region from 400&nbsp;nm to 700&nbsp;nm.
Therefore, most microscope objectives are optimized for that wavelength range, with most emphasis on the region from 480&nbsp;nm to 640&nbsp;nm.
However, there are objectives with an enhanced range of e.g. 400&nbsp;nm to 950&nbsp;nm, and others which work further in the infrared.
For example, that is required for <a href="laser_microscopy.html" title="a technique for generating microscopic images by scanning objects with a laser">laser microscopes</a> where infrared laser beams need to be transmitted.</p>
<p>Note that it is essential not only to have a good <a href="transmittance.html" title="the ratio of transmitted optical power to the incident optical power at some partial transparent object">transmittance</a> over the full wavelength range, but also <a href="achromatic_optics.html" title="optical devices or setups with minimized chromatic aberrations">achromatic</a> performance.
In conventional light microscopes, this is needed to avoid colored image distortions.
In <a href="confocal_scanning_microscopes.html" title="optical microscopes with enhanced depth resolution based on the confocal measurement principle">confocal</a> multi-photon <a href="fluorescence_microscopy.html" title="a technique for acquiring microscopic images using fluorescence which is excited in the sample">fluorescence microscopes</a>, it is important to have the same focus positions for infrared laser light as for the <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> light.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Labels on Objectives</h2>
<div>
<p>The key parameters are often easily found on laser-engraved labels on the outer barrel of an objective.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The label &ldquo;50&times; / 0.8&rdquo; indicates a 50&thinsp;&times; magnification and a numerical aperture of 0.8, probably of a dry objective.</li>
<li>&ldquo;100&times; / 1.30 oil&rdquo; indicates a 100&thinsp;&times; magnification and a numerical aperture of 1.30, reached with immersion oil.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&infin; / 0.17&rdquo; indicates an infinity-corrected objective with compensation of spherical aberrations for a cover slip thickness of 0.17&nbsp;mm, while &ldquo;160 / 0.17&rdquo; indicates a finite-corrected objective for microscopes with 160&nbsp;mm tube length and the same cover slip thickness.</li>
<li>&ldquo;WD 0.21&rdquo; indicates a <a href="working_distance.html" title="the distance between an objective and the object">working distance</a> of 0.21&nbsp;mm.</li>
<li>&ldquo;DIC&rdquo; indicates a design for differential index contrast imaging.</li>
<li>&ldquo;plan fluor&rdquo; indicates a plan-apochromatic objective, i.e., with flat field correction and apochromat properties.</li>
<li>&ldquo;DIN&rdquo; indicates that the objective is made according to the DIN (Deutsche Industrie Norm) microscope standard concerning the tube length, while &ldquo;JIS&rdquo; indicates the Japanese standard with somewhat longer tube.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Threads for Microscope Objectives</h2>
<div>
<p>In most cases, a microscope objective is mounted on the nosepiece of a microscope using a thread.
Unfortunately, there are different thread sizes used by different manufacturers and for objectives of different kinds.
In some cases, special adapters can be used for applying an objective to a microscope with different threads.</p>
<p>Objectives for dark-field illumination are tentatively larger, providing extra space for the illumination light; therefore, they are typically used with larger threads.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Other Qualities of Microscope Objectives</h2>
<div>
<p>Another practically important factor is the <a href="working_distance.html" title="the distance between an objective and the object"><em>working distance</em></a>, i.e., the distance between the objective and the object.
Small working distances are generally required for objectives with high NA, but also can to some extent be optimized as a design goal (possibly somewhat compromising the NA or the correction).
For objectives with oil immersion, a relatively small working distance is actually good, since otherwise one would require more of the immersion fluid, and that would be more difficult to hold in place.</p>
<p>Some microscopes allow the injection of illumination light through the objective to the sample.
It is then important that there is no significant <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattering</a> of light in the objective.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Design of Microscope Objectives</h2>
<div>
<p>Although a microscope objective is sometimes called the <em>objective lens</em>, it usually contains multiple lenses.
The higher the numerical aperture and the higher the required image quality, the more sophisticated designs are needed.
High-end microscope objectives may also involve <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric</a> lenses.</p>
<p>The design of a high quality microscope objective is a rather sophisticated task, for which substantial optics expertise and powerful optics design software are required.
Such designs involve complicated trade-offs, which should be properly handled according to the importance of different aspects for a particular application.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Beam Focusing and Fiber Coupling with Microscope Objectives</h2>
<div>
<p>Microscope objectives are sometimes used for applications outside microscopy.
For example, they can be used for tight focusing of <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>, with spot sizes of a few micrometers or even below 1&nbsp;&mu;m.
If the input beam is a <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated beam</a>, an infinity-corrected objective will work best.
The objective should have a <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> which fits well to the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> related to the required spot size.
The input <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> should also be chosen appropriately, i.e., calculated from the required spot size and the focal length.
A difficulty may be to find out the focal length, as the objective barrel often only indicates the magnification, and the conversion to the focal length depends on the microscope design.</p>
<p>Another application is launching light into a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a> or collimating light from such a fiber.
Again, the objective should have an appropriate numerical aperture of the order of that of the fiber.
For more details, see the article on <a href="fiber_launch_systems.html" title="optical systems for launching light into optical fibers">fiber launch systems</a>.</p>
<p>For such applications, <a href="chromatic_aberrations.html" title="image distortions caused by wavelength-dependent optical effects">chromatic aberrations</a> are often no issue, so that one does not exploit the chromatic correction of the objective.
Also, a wide field of view would not be required.
On the other hand, a microscope objective for visible light may well not have ideal properties e.g. for launching near infrared light into a fiber, and its power handling capability is limited (but usually not specified).
Therefore, a microscope objective may not be the ideal solution for such an application.
However, it may have to be used, e.g. if no other lenses are available for reaching the required small spot size.</p>

<h2>Shortages of rare earth materials &ndash; a problem for photonics?</h2>
<p>Photonics heavily depends on the supply of rare earth materials in various areas &ndash; think of <a href="./laser_crystals.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">laser crystals</a>, <a href="./rare_earth_doped_fibers.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">active fibers</a> and <a href="./light_emitting_diodes.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">LEDs</a>, for example.
It is hard to see how such things could be done without rare earth materials.
And those have recently been subject to enormous price increases and were even involved in a trade war.</p>
<p>Is that now a reason for serious concerns in the area of photonics?
Do we need to undertake serious recycling efforts?
Our <a href="./spotlight_2014_06_27.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">Photonics Spotlight article</a> analyzes the situation.</p>
<p>Receiving the <a href="./spotlight.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">Photonics Spotlight</a> via our <a href="./newsletters.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">newsletter</a> might be a good idea &hellip;</p>
