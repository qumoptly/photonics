<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a> and <a href="nonlinear_polarization.html" title="the part of the light-induced electric polarization which depends nonlinearly on the electric field of the light">nonlinear polarization</a>; G. D. Boyd and D. A. Kleinman, &ldquo;Parametric interaction of focused Gaussian light beams&rdquo;, J. Appl. Phys. 39 (8), 3597 (1968)</p>
<p>If you send a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> into a <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal</a> where <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a> (second-harmonic generation) occurs, you will often find the second-harmonic beam to have a smaller <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a>, compared to that of the pump beam.
This is worth some thoughts.</p>
<p>For a large <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated beam</a>, the mentioned effect can be easily understood by considering that the magnitude of <a href="nonlinear_polarization.html" title="the part of the light-induced electric polarization which depends nonlinearly on the electric field of the light">nonlinear polarization</a> caused by the pump beam is proportional to the <em>square</em> of the electric field.
So if you have a <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian</a> pump beam, the nonlinear polarization wave also has a Gaussian shape, but with a smaller radius.
As that nonlinear polarization wave is the source of the second-harmonic beam, it is clear that the second-harmonic beam will come out smaller.</p>
<p>For a focused beam in the crystal (as is more common), the situation is somewhat more complicated, as the beam radius varies during propagation.
It is essential then to also consider the phase properties.
The nonlinear polarization must of course have phase fronts which coincide with those of the pump beam.
Therefore, the same should hold for the wavefronts of the generated second-harmonic beam.
This means that pump and second-harmonic beam should have the same focus position and also the same <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a>.
Given that the second-harmonic beam has half the wavelength, it should have half the <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> at the focus.
This indeed fits well to the smaller extent of the nonlinear polarization wave.</p>
<p>It is clear that in a situation with <a href="spatial_walk_off.html" title="the phenomenon that the intensity distribution of a beam in an anisotropic crystal drifts away from the direction of the wave vector">spatial walk-off</a>, as occurs for <a href="critical_phase_matching.html" title="phase matching of a nonlinear interaction by adjustment of a propagation direction">critical phase matching</a>, the situation gets more complicated: the second-harmonic beam gets larger in one direction, and its wavefronts will subsequently deviate from those of the pump beam.
However, even without spatial walk-off there is a problem with the <a href="gouy_phase_shift.html" title="an additional phase shift occurring in the propagation of focused Gaussian beams">Gouy phase shift</a>.
That deviation from the phase evolution of a <a href="plane_waves.html" title="waves with plane wavefronts">plane wave</a> occurs for both pump and second-harmonic beam, of course.
Nevertheless, the effects of the Gouy phase on both beams do <em>not</em> exactly cancel each other.
The nonlinear polarization goes with the square of the pump field, so it gets the Gouy phase shift twice, while the second-harmonic wave can have it only once.
This means that for strong focusing the wavefronts do not match each other as nicely as one might expect from the above considerations.
That mismatch has been recognized early on, and is discussed in detail in the famous paper of Boyd and Kleinman (see the reference above).
It has a significant impact on the pump beam radius for optimum conversion efficiency.
It turns out that this optimum indeed requires a slight phase mismatch, which can partly compensate the mismatch of Gouy phase shifts.
This means that the optimum crystal temperature for tightly focused beams can somewhat differ from that for larger beams.</p>
