<p>The term optical sensor can mean two different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are sensors for light, essentially sensing properties like an <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> or <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">intensity</a>.</li>
<li>Other devices are sensing non-optical properties such as forces, displacements and tilts, strain, temperature, chemical or electrical properties, and somehow use light for that purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="togglediv">Sensors for Light</h2>
<div>
<p>Various properties of light can be addressed with certain kinds of optical sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>In most cases, an <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> or <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">intensity</a> is sensed.
For that purpose, one often uses a <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a> or some other kind of <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a>.
Sometimes, however, one uses a <a href="thermal_detectors.html" title="light detectors which are based on measuring light-induced temperature rises">thermal detector</a>, where one converts the optical radiation into heat and measures the resulting temperature increase, typically with electronic means.
The power or intensity sensors can be integrated into measurement instruments like <a href="optical_power_meters.html" title="instruments for optical power measurements, based e.g. on heating of an absorber structure or a photodiode">optical power meters</a> and <a href="optical_power_monitors.html" title="devices for monitoring optical powers in free-space light beams or in optical fibers">optical power monitors</a>.</li>
<li>There are applications where one needs to sense the spatial position of a light beam.
For such purposes, there are <a href="position_sensitive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which can detect the position of a light spot in one or two dimensions">position-sensitive detectors</a> of different kinds, some of them with extraordinarily high spatial resolution.</li>
<li>Other optical sensors can test additional properties of light beams or of diffuse light, for example concerning <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a> or the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Sensors Utilizing Light</h2>
<div>
<p>In this section, sensors are explained which measure non-optical properties based on a measurement principle which involves the use of light.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Optical sensors can have substantial advantages over competing technologies, for example concerning performance or the usability under extreme conditions.</aside>
<p>Such sensors are competing with other sensor technologies, e.g. based on purely electronic means.
Compared with those, optical sensors are often more expensive, but may nevertheless be preferable due to specific advantages.
For example, for sensing applications in specific harsh environments exhibiting complicating aspects such as intense electric fields, radio waves or extreme temperatures, it can be advantageous to have a relatively robust and non-conducting sensor element such as an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>, possibly containing a <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg grating</a>.
Such types of sensors can work without creating insulation problems or explosion hazards, requiring electrical power at an inconvenient location or being excessively influenced by certain disturbances in the surroundings.
Another aspect is the sometimes superior performance, for example the extremely high resolution with which mechanical strain can be measured, particularly in case of <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometric</a> sensors.</p>
<p>In some cases, one uses an optical sensing instrument to which one or several external optical sensors are connected.
For example, one may have multiple or even many <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a> incorporated in a long optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>, or use a kind of distributed sensing along the whole length of fiber.
A possible measurement principle is to infer locations from the arrival times of pulse signals, utilizing the finite <a href="velocity_of_light.html" title="the velocity with which light propagates in a medium">velocity of light</a>.
Such a distributed sensor system can also be substantially more economical than a system being based on a long chain of electronic sensor elements, requiring many electrical cables or a sophisticated electronic bus system.</p>
<p>In the following, we discuss the most common types of optical sensors (grouped by the measured quantities) without striving to generate anything close to a complete overview of sensor technologies, as this is a huge field.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Presence Sensors</h3>
<div>
<p>Sensors based on the principle of a light barrier are often used for detecting the presence of persons or some other objects.
Here, one sends a light beam, e.g. a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> from an infrared <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a>, through a certain area and detects the arriving beam, which may e.g. be blocked by a person entering the area.</p>
<p>Similarly, optical sensors may utilize scattered light or emitted <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">thermal radiation</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Optical Sensors for Mechanical Quantities</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Fiber-optic sensors for strain, displacements, tilts, rotation, forces and acceleration have become quite common and can have amazing performance figures.</aside>
<p>A wide range of optical sensors can be used for measuring and monitoring mechanical quantities such as forces, displacements and tilts (= rotational position changes), and strain.
They can be based on very different measurement principles.
For example, position changes can be very accurately monitored with various kinds of <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a>, which may be realized either with bulk optics or with <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a>.
The same principles can be employed for measuring mechanical forces, because those can easily be converted into displacements, using the elastic deformation of some mechanical part.
Similarly, accelerations can be measured e.g. through the relative motion of a test mass or through inertial forces.
Also, there are various methods of sensing vibrations, partly with high temporal resolution and sensitivity.
For sensing rotations, there are optical gyroscopes, e.g. based on <a href="ring_lasers.html" title="lasers with a ring resonator">ring lasers</a>, which can be extremely sensitive.</p>
<p>Many of those devices are realized in the form of <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a> &ndash; often but not always utilizing <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a>.
Frequently, such sensors are also sensitive to temperature changes, but there are various ways of separating such influences; in fact, there are many sensors which simultaneously can measure strain and temperature, for example.
A frequently used technique is to utilize two identical fiber Bragg gratings, where both gratings are exposed to the same temperature, but only one of them to a certain strain.
See the article on <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Optical Temperature Sensors</h3>
<div>
<p>The probably most frequently used technology for optical temperature sensors is based on <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a>.
Here, the narrow reflection peak of such a grating has a peak wavelength which significantly depends on the temperature.
It is not a problem that it also can be influenced by strain, if such mechanical influences are avoided with suitable packaging.</p>
<p>See the article on <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Fire and Smoke Sensors</h3>
<div>
<p>Fire can be detected in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>One can sense the resulting increase in temperature with some kind of temperature sensor, see above.</li>
<li>One can measure the generated <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">thermal radiation</a> (heat radiation, <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a>) with a kind of <a href="infrared_detectors.html" title="detectors for infrared light">infrared detector</a>.</li>
<li>One can detect the generated smoke.
It has become very common in households, for example, to use optical smoke alarm devices, which detect the scattering of light generated by a small <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light emitting diode</a> (LED); that light may be scattered towards a nearby photodetector, which is mounted such that without smoke the generated light cannot reach it.
Usually, the light source is not operated continuously, but for example only once every 30 seconds, and a loud alarm signal is generated if smoke is detected, so that persons are alarmed and can hopefully flee in time and/or take countermeasures.
Due to the low electricity consumption in normal monitoring mode, a compact battery may last for years.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Chemical Sensors</h3>
<div>
<p>Chemical sensors may react to the concentration of a certain substance or to some chemical parameters such as the pH value, indicating the degree of acidity.
Various types of optical sensors have been developed which can be used for such purposes.
They can be based on very different operation principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The quantity of interest may modify the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> or the optical <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> of a substance, which can be monitored with light.
Here, one may require wavelength-dependent measurements; that is done, for example, in colorimetric sensors.</li>
<li>In other cases, certain chemicals emit <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescent light</a> (often excited in a controlled manner with some incident probe light) which may be sensitively detected &ndash; possibly even with substantial spatial resolution.</li>
<li>Frequently, some kind of probe light interacts with a chemical sample, e.g. with a free-space beam traversing a measurement cell, or with a very localized contact of evanescent light from a kind of <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> with the surrounding medium.</li>
<li>Some agent may be attracted by certain chemicals, and by measuring optical effects of that agent one may infer the concentration of the other chemicals.</li>
<li>Chemical sensing may also be accomplished over large distances, e.g. up to positions high in the atmosphere of Earth, with <a href="lidar.html" title="a technique for acquiring 3D images with laser pulses">LIDAR</a> techniques.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Sensors for Electric and Magnetic Quantities</h3>
<div>
<p>There are various ways in which electric quantities can be monitored with optical means.
For example, the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> of certain crystal materials depends linearly on the applied electrical field strength.
That <em>electro-optic effect</em> can be utilized for electro-optical sampling, e.g. in investigations of certain electronic chips.</p>
<p>Similarly, one can exploit the Faraday effect for optical sensors addressing magnetic fields.
Since magnetic fields are often generated by electrical currents, that can also be used to make current sensors, which can be advantageous e.g. for measuring currents in harsh high-voltage environments such as ultrahigh voltage power transmission systems, including sub-surface cables.</p>
