<p>A fiber-optic link (or <em>fiber channel</em>) is a part of an <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> system which provides a data connection between two points (<em>point-to-point connection</em>).
It essentially consists of a data transmitter, a transmission <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> (in some cases with built-in <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>), and a receiver.
Even for very long transmission distances, extremely high data rates of many Gbit/s or even several Tbit/s can be achieved.</p>
<p>The used components, which are mostly based on <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a>, are explained in the following, beginning with a simple single-channel system.
More sophisticated approaches are discussed thereafter.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Transmission Formats</h2>
<div>
<p>In most cases, the data transmission is digital, making the system very versatile and relatively insensitive, e.g. to <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear</a> distortions.
There are various different <em>modulation formats</em>, i.e., different methods for encoding the information.
For example, a simple non-return-to-zero (NRZ) format transmits subsequent bits by sending a high or low <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> value, with no gaps between the bits, and extra means for synchronization.
In contrast, a return-to-zero (RZ) format is easily self-synchronizing by returning to a rest state after each bit, but it requires a higher optical transmission <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> for the same data rate.
Apart from details of the equipment and the optical bandwidth required (related to the <em>modulation efficiency</em>), different transmission formats also differ in terms of their sensitivity e.g. to noise influences and cross-talk.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Transmitter</h2>
<div>
<p>The transmitter converts the electronic input signal into a modulated light beam.
The information may be encoded e.g. via the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> (<a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">intensity</a>), <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phase</a> or polarization; intensity modulation is most common.
The optical wavelength is typically in one of the so-called <em>telecom windows</em> (see the article on <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>).</p>
<p>A typical transmitter is based on a <a href="single_mode_operation.html" title="operation of a laser on axial (longitudinal) resonator modes only, or even on a single axial mode">single-mode</a> <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> (normally a <a href="vertical_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="a monolithic kind of semiconductor lasers with beam emission perpendicular to the wafer surface">VCSEL</a> or a <a href="distributed_feedback_lasers.html" title="lasers where the whole laser resonator consists of a periodic structure, in which Bragg reflection occurs">DFB laser</a>), which may either be directly modulated via its drive current (DML = <em>directly modulated laser</em>), or with an external <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulator</a> (e.g. an <a href="electroabsorption_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the Franz&ndash;Keldysh effect">electroabsorption</a> or Mach&ndash;Zehnder modulator).
Direct modulation is the simpler option, and can work at data rates of 10&nbsp;Gbit/s or even higher.
However, the varying carrier density in the laser diode then leads to a varying <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a> and thus to signal distortions in the form of a <a href="chirp.html" title="time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirp</a>.
Particularly for long transmission distances, this makes the signal more sensitive to the influence of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>.
Therefore, external modulation is usually preferred for the combination of high data rates (e.g. 10 or 40&nbsp;Gbit/s) with long transmission distances (many kilometers).
The <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> can then operate in <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave mode</a>, and signal distortions are minimized.</p>
<p>For even higher single-channel data rates, <a href="time_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique operating in the time domain">time division multiplexing</a> may be employed, where e.g. four channels with 40&nbsp;Gbit/s are temporally interleaved to obtain a total rate of 160&nbsp;Gbit/s.
For high data rates with return-to-zero formats, it can be advantageous to use a pulsed source (e.g. a <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a> emitting <a href="solitons.html" title="pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects">soliton</a> pulses) combined with an <a href="intensity_modulators.html" title="devices which can be used to modulate the intensity (power) of a light beam">intensity modulator</a>.
This reduces the bandwidth demands on the modulator, as it does not matter how the modulator's <a href="transmittance.html" title="the ratio of transmitted optical power to the incident optical power at some partial transparent object">transmittance</a> evolves between the pulses.</p>
<p>For high data rates, the transmitter needs to meet a number of requirements.
In particular, it is important to achieve a high extinction ratio (low pedestal pulses), a low <a href="timing_jitter.html" title="fluctuations of the temporal positions of pulses">timing jitter</a>, low <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a>, and a precisely controlled clock rate.
Of course, a data transmitter should operate stably and reliably with minimum operator intervention.</p>
<p>In simple cases, a <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diode</a> (LED) is used in the transmitter, but due to the poor spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> this requires the use of <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>.
The transmission rate or distance is then restricted due to <a href="intermodal_dispersion.html" title="the phenomenon that the group velocity of light propagating in a waveguide structure depends on the waveguide mode">intermodal dispersion</a>; for a longer <a href="bandwidth_distance_product.html" title="product of length and maximum signal bandwidth of a fiber-optic link">bandwidth&ndash;distance product</a>, <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a> are required.
For short distances, several hundred Mbit/s are possible.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Transmission Fiber</h2>
<div>
<p>The transmission fiber is usually a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a> in the case of medium or long-distance transmission, but can also be a <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fiber</a> for short distances.
In the latter case, <a href="intermodal_dispersion.html" title="the phenomenon that the group velocity of light propagating in a waveguide structure depends on the waveguide mode">intermodal dispersion</a> can limit the transmission distance or bit rate.</p>
<p>Long-range broadband fiber channels can contain <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> at certain points (<em>lumped amplifiers</em>) to prevent the power level from dropping to too low a level.
Alternatively, it is possible to use a <a href="distributed_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers in fiber-optic data links, where the amplification occurs within a large length of transmission fiber">distributed amplifier</a>, realized with the transmission fiber itself, by injecting an additional powerful pump beam (typically from the receiver end) which generates <a href="raman_gain.html" title="optical gain arising from stimulated Raman scattering">Raman gain</a>.
In addition, means for <a href="dispersion_compensation.html" title="the control of the overall chromatic dispersion of a system by adding optical elements with a suitable amount of dispersion">dispersion compensation</a> (counteracting the effects of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> of the fiber) and for <em>signal regeneration</em> may be employed.
The latter means that not only the power level but also the signal quality (e.g. pulse width and timing) is restored.
This can be achieved either with purely optical signal processing, or by detecting the signal electronically, applying some optical signal processing, and resending the signal.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Receiver</h2>
<div>
<p>The receiver contains some type of fast <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a>, normally a <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a>, and suitable high-speed electronics for amplifying the weak signal (e.g. with a transimpedance amplifier) and extracting the digital (or sometimes analog) data.
For high data rates, circuitry for <a href="electronic_dispersion_compensation.html" title="a method for mitigating the effects of chromatic dispersion in fiber-optic communication links with electronic components in the receiver">electronic dispersion compensation</a> may be included.</p>
<p><a href="avalanche_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with internal signal amplification through an avalanche process">Avalanche photodiodes</a> can be used for particularly high sensitivity.
The sensitivity of the receiver is limited by noise, normally of electronic origin.
Note, however, that the optical signal itself is accompanied by optical noise, such as <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">amplifier noise</a>.
Such optical noise introduces limitations which can not be removed with any receiver design.
Noise effects are discussed below in more detail.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Bidirectional Transmission</h2>
<div>
<p>So-called <em>full duplex links</em> provide a data connection in both directions.
These may simply be based on separate optical fibers, or work with a single fiber.
The latter can be realized e.g. by using fiber-optic <a href="beam_splitters.html" title="devices for splitting a laser beam into two or more beams">beam splitters</a> at each end to connect a transmitter and a receiver.
However, the need for bidirectional operation introduces various trade-offs, which in some cases (e.g. for very high data rates) make a system with two separate fibers preferable.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Multiplexing</h2>
<div>
<p>A typical single-channel system for long-haul transmission has a transmission capacity of e.g. 2.5 or 10&nbsp;Gbit/s; higher data rates of 40&nbsp;Gbit/s or even 160&nbsp;Gbit/s may be used in the future.
For higher data rates, several data channels can be multiplexed (combined), transmitted through the fiber, and separated again for detection.</p>
<p>The most common technique is <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain"><em>wavelength division multiplexing</em></a> (WDM).
Here, different center wavelengths are assigned to different data channels.
It is possible to combine even hundreds of channels in that way (<em>DWDM</em> = <em>dense WDM</em>), but <em>coarse WDM</em> with a moderate number of channels is often preferred in order to keep the system simpler.
The main challenges are to suppress channel cross-talk via <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>, to balance the channel powers (e.g. with <a href="gain_equalization.html" title="a technique for making the gain spectrum of an optical amplifier device flatter over a certain optical frequency range">gain-flattened</a> <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>), and to simplify the systems.</p>
<p>Another approach is <a href="time_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique operating in the time domain"><em>time division multiplexing</em></a>, where several input channels are combined by nesting in the time domain, and <a href="solitons.html" title="pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects">solitons</a> are often used to ensure that the sent <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> stay cleanly separated even at small pulse-to-pulse spacings.</p>
<p>For short distances, for example for connections within data centers, it can be simpler to use ribbon fiber cables with multiple fibers and corresponding numbers of transmitters and receivers.
However, a disadvantage of that approach is that the cables become bulkier.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Active Optical Cables</h2>
<div>
<p>For short transmission distances, so-called <em>active optical cables</em> (AOC) can be used, where a transmitter and a receiver (together with corresponding electronics) are rigidly attached to the ends of an optical fiber cable.
Common electrical interfaces such as USB or HDMI ports are available, so that the use of such an active optical cable is essentially the same as that of an electrical cable, while offering advantages like reduced diameter and weight and also a larger possible transmission distance.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber to the Home</h2>
<div>
<p>It is possible to use optical links even to supply data over the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; to single homes and offices.
This technology is called <a href="fiber_to_the_home.html" title="the technology of providing data connections to private homes via optical fibers rather than electric cables"><em>fiber to the home</em></a> (FTTH).
In many cases, however, the last mile is still bridged with copper cables, and fiber-optic transmission occurs only up to some small stations close to the users.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Limitations via Noise and Cross-talk</h2>
<div>
<p>Ultimately, the data transmission capacity of any system is limited by noise.
In amplified optical systems, <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a> e.g. in the form of <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> in <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device"><em>amplifier noise</em></a>) is not avoidable.
It can impact the system performance in different forms, such as <a href="timing_jitter.html" title="fluctuations of the temporal positions of pulses">timing jitter</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="gordon_haus_jitter.html" title="a timing jitter originating from fluctuations of the center frequency"><em>Gordon&ndash;Haus jitter</em></a>, particularly in soliton systems) or <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a> affecting the <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetection</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from noise, certain systematic signal distortions can also limit the transmission distance or bit error rate.
In particular, <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> of the transmission fiber can cause severe signal distortions.
As an example, Figure&nbsp;2 shows a so-called <em>eye diagram</em>.
Here, the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; is wide open, so that the signal could still be well detected.
For twice the fiber length (not shown here), this would be different.</p>

<p>Note that the transmitter also has an important impact on signal detection issues.
For example, a simple directly modulated transmitter may produce some unwanted frequency <a href="chirp.html" title="time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirp</a>, which increases the effect of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> in the transmission fiber and thus makes it more difficult to receive a clean signal after some propagation distance.</p>
<p>A related and even more sophisticated topic is cross-talk between the different channels e.g. of a WDM system.
In systems with constant channel spacing, the channels can also influence each other in the form that one channel is amplified at the expense of the power in another channel (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="four_wave_mixing.html" title="an interaction of light waves based on a &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity"><em>four-wave mixing</em></a>).
The impact of such effects can depend strongly on the system architecture, including the transmitter type, modulation format, fiber parameters, detection techniques, etc.
The <a href="pulse_propagation_modeling.html" title="working with physical models describing the propagation of ultrashort pulses e.g. in lasers or optical fibers">modeling</a> of these effects and the subsequent optimization of communication systems are complex tasks.</p>
<p>Noise and related influences always cause some <a href="bit_error_rate.html" title="average fraction of wrongly transmitted bits in a communication link">bit error rate</a>, i.e., some portion of the transmitted bits will not be correctly detected.
Provided that the bit error rate is at a sufficiently low level, occasional bit errors can be detected with certain techniques and corrected (e.g. by resending of defective data packets).
For increasing transmission distances and/or data rates, the bit error rate finally sets some limits.
In that context, the <a href="bandwidth_distance_product.html" title="product of length and maximum signal bandwidth of a fiber-optic link">bandwidth&ndash;distance product</a> is often used in a comparison of different fiber-optic links.</p>
