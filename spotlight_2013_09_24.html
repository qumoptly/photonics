<p class="ref">Ref.: <a href="fiberpower_qs_yag_bp.html">case study on a Q-switched laser</a>; R. Paschotta, &ldquo;Beam quality deterioration of lasers caused by intracavity beam distortions&rdquo;, Opt. Express 14 (13), 6069 (2006)</p>
<p><a href="laser_modeling.html" title="the investigation of phenomena and quantitative relations in lasers, using theoretical models and computational methods">Laser modeling</a> is often based on certain assumptions, which might not always be well fulfilled in practice.
This is particularly the case for analytical models, which often require more assumptions in order to keep the problem manageable.
Purely numerical simulations are better in this respect.
Here, I present a nice example for that.</p>
<p>In simulations of laser performance, we often assume that we get a certain beam size &ndash; for example, the size of the fundamental <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">mode</a>.
For most bulk lasers with stable transverse <a href="single_mode_operation.html" title="operation of a laser on axial (longitudinal) resonator modes only, or even on a single axial mode">single-mode operation</a>, this is a well fulfilled assumption.
I wondered, however, whether <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">gain guiding</a> in a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a> might have a significant effect.
After all, the laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> is often pretty high in such a laser, so that gain guiding might pull the beam size away from that of the fundamental mode &ndash; presumably to a smaller value.
As strong <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a> then sets in, the gain guiding effect changes during pulse formation, making things somewhat complicated.</p>
<p>The way to check such things is, of course, to numerically simulate the pulse formation &ndash; not just the dynamics of the optical power, but of the full beam profile.
The new version V5 of our <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a> software is a great tool for such things, even though it has actually be designed for <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a>, not for bulk lasers.
One simply defines the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> profile and the gain profile for the bulk laser resonator, just as if it were a piece of fiber.
In that case, it doesn't form a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>, except if one also includes <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, which I didn't do here in order to focus on gain guiding.
(It is one of the nice feature of numerical tests that you can easily eliminate effects which you are not interested in at the moment.)</p>
<p>The results first came out pretty much as one might expect them.
A nice pulse was generated, when a weak seed beam was injected into the resonator after pumping the crystal.
(One might also simulate the start-up from <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a>, but here I started up with a clean seed beam as I was interested only in what happens when the powers get large and <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a> sets in.)
Here is the evolution of output power and beam radius:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiberpower_qs_yag_bp1.png" alt="pulse shape from Q-switched laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Evolution of output power and beam radius, the latter based on the second moment of the intensity distribution.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As expected, I saw some moderate fluctuations of beam size:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiberpower_qs_yag_bp3.png" alt="evolution of the beam profiles">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Evolution of the beam profiles during the pulse. For each profile, the color scale is calibrated such that the deep red color applies to the highest intensity. (In that way, we remove the large power variation.)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The beam, starting with a Gaussian beam fitting the resonator mode (without gain guiding), quickly adapted to a somewhat smaller size due to the gain guiding.
(Nevertheless, the second-moment-based beam radius actually gets somewhat larger due to wings of the profile.)
When the pulse maximum was reached after 13 resonator round-trips, the beam got larger and finally settled at a size close to the resonator mode size.</p>
<p>Then I did the same again for modified values of the resonator length.
There was an air gap of initially 20&nbsp;mm between the laser crystal and the right end mirror.
When this was increased up to 30&nbsp;mm, the mode size hardly changed at all.
Therefore, nobody would have been surprised to see that for 30&nbsp;mm air gap width one gets quite the same as before.
However, for a spacing of just 25&nbsp;mm &ndash; not for 23 or 27&nbsp;mm &ndash; something strange happened:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiberpower_qs_yag_bp5.png" alt="evolution of the beam profiles">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Same as Figure&nbsp;2, but with a spacing of 25&nbsp;mm (instead of 20&nbsp;mm) between crystal and end mirror.
Note: the discrete steps are not the result of insufficient numerical resolution, but of significant changes in beam size during a single resonator round-trip.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One can see that now the beam shrinks substantially during the pulse build-up, and later evolves into a kind of donut shape.
Although that shape is rather pronounced, it would be difficult to detect experimentally, as that requires a time-resolved measurement.
(The temporarily integrated beam profile, weighted with the optical power, does not show much &ndash; just a certain deviation from a Gaussian beam profile.)
If one would put a photodiode at different portions of the beam, one would find different temporal pulse shapes and durations.</p>
<p>Apparently, the laser resonator is substantially more sensitive to the gain guiding effect for that particular resonator length &ndash; but why is that?
The explanation is far from obvious.
A resonator design analysis (done with the <a href="resonator.html">RP Resonator</a> software) shows that just for 25&nbsp;mm air gap size, the <a href="gouy_phase_shift.html" title="an additional phase shift occurring in the propagation of focused Gaussian beams">Gouy phase shift</a> of the resonator per round trip becomes 1.59&nbsp;rad, which is close to &pi;/2 (= 1.57&nbsp;rad).
A consequence of that is that the TEM<sub>40</sub> and TEM<sub>22</sub> modes have resonance frequencies which coincide with resonances of the TEM<sub>00</sub> fundamental mode.
At this point, some resonant mode coupling can occur, which has a strong impact on the beam profiles (see R. Paschotta, &ldquo;Beam quality deterioration of lasers caused by intracavity beam distortions&rdquo;, Opt. Express 14 (13), 6069 (2006)).</p>
<p>This example shows that substantial effects, which might impact performance and also applications of the laser beam, could easily stay hidden with analytical simulations, requiring assumptions such as a constant beam size.
Moreover, even in experiments one would probably not recognize what is going on &ndash; maybe only that the performance is not quite as good as expected.
It would then be very hard to find out what's the matter.</p>
<p>By the way, I wouldn't say that the numerical approach is always better &ndash; ideally, you are able to use both approaches.
In our example case, numerical modeling brings up interesting details, but only analytical considerations (see the cited paper) can well explain them.</p>

    "description": "A nice example for numerical simulations of beam propagation in Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers shows that unexpected effects can be found with numerical simulations, but not so easily with analytical models or with experiments. However, you then need analytical reasoning to really understand what is going on.",
