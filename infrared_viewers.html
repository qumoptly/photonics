<p>In laboratories, one is often dealing with <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a>, e.g. in the form of infrared <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">beams</a> emitted by <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>.
It can then be difficult e.g. to follow a beam path or to check a beam position without any visual aid.
Therefore, one often uses infrared viewers (IR viewers), i.e., devices which effectively make infrared light visible.
One can look into the <a href="ocular_lenses.html" title="lenses or lens systems as used in telescopes and microscopes, for example, close to the observing eye">ocular lens</a> (eyepiece) of such a viewer and see an image which is created from infrared light entering the device through the <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objective</a> on the opposite side.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Operation Principle</h2>
<div>
<p>The basic operation principle of an infrared viewer is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrared light from some source, entering the objective, is imaged onto some image converter.
That device has a <a href="photocathodes.html" title="an electrode where electrons can be released based on the photoelectric effect">photocathode</a> (a photosensitive area) inside an evacuated tube where photoelectrons can be generated by incident infrared radiation.</li>
<li>The generated photoelectrons are accelerated by a strong electric field (created by applying a high voltage of e.g. several kilovolts) and then hit a <a href="phosphors.html" title="substances which exhibit luminescence, used mostly for illumination and displays">phosphor</a> on the opposite side of the tube.
There, the electrons cause the phosphor to glow; depending on the type of phosphor, the color of the emitted light may e.g. be green.
(The emitted light color is independent of the <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> of the radiation hitting the photocathode.)
As electrons generated on different locations on the photocathode are sent to different locations on the phosphor, a visible image is created there.</li>
<li>The visible light can then get through the ocular into an eye of the user, so that a visible image can be generated on the retina.</li>
</ul>
<p>The precise technology used in the image converter is usually not revealed in product descriptions, except for the used photocathode material, which determines the <a href="spectral_response_of_a_photodetector.html" title="the range of optical wavelengths for which a photodetector is sensitive">spectral response</a> (see below).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Observing Laser Beams and Light in Optical Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>Of course, only light entering the objective of the viewer device can contribute to a perceived image.
That is not the case for a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> not entering the device.
However, some tiny part of the power of a laser beam may be scattered in air (e.g. at dust particles) and therefore nevertheless create a visible image of the laser beam, if its <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> is high enough and the observation distance is not too large.</p>
<p>In practice, one often does not directly observe laser beams, but only randomly scattered light which one obtains when a laser beam is hitting some diffusing surface of a white card or screen, for example.</p>
<p>Light propagating in optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> can also often be observed due to <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattering</a> of light at inhomogeneous of the fiber core or the core&ndash;cladding interface.
In case of <a href="active_fibers.html" title="optical fibers containing laser-active dopants in the fiber core">active fibers</a> (<a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>), one can often observe <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> light from the laser-active ions.
Of course, one does not obtain any information on the emitted wavelengths.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Spectral Response</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout red">The sensitivity of the viewer often varies enormously with in the specified wavelength range!</aside>
<p>Image converters have a strongly wavelength-dependent sensitivity.
Many of the used materials have a high sensitivity for visible light &ndash; which can be useful, because this allows one to see not only the infrared radiation or objects hit by that radiation, but also any objects illuminated by normal daylight or room lights.
In addition, they are sensitive to some part of the infrared spectrum.
For some devices, the sensitivity falls off quite rapidly above for certain critical wavelength (e.g. 1.3&nbsp;&mu;m), while for others it decreases quite smoothly for longer and longer wavelengths.
Particularly in the latter case, the usable wavelength range depends on the intensity of the observed infrared light, because the lower sensitivity sufficient if the incident intensity is high enough.</p>
<p>For work in the area of <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, it is normally sufficient to have a near infrared viewer working up to wavelengths around 2&nbsp;&mu;m, because light with longer wavelengths could anyway not be transmitted through <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>, and one usually deals with light only up to &asymp;1.6&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
<p>Even within the usable wavelength range specified by the manufacturer, the sensitivity can vary enormously.
The observable intensity levels may vary by more than a factor of 100 within that wavelength range.
For example, a near-infrared viewer with the common S1 photocathode material (Ag-O-Cs: based on silver oxide, doped with cesium, used since 1930) is said to be usable for about 0.4&nbsp;&mu;m to 1.2&nbsp;&mu;m or even 1.3&nbsp;&mu;m; it is reasonably sensitive to 1064-nm light from a <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">YAG laser</a> (although much less than at 0.8&nbsp;&mu;m), while far higher intensities are required to see anything at 1.2&nbsp;&mu;m or even 1.3&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
<p>There are also mid- and long-wave <a href="infrared_cameras.html" title="cameras which work with infrared light">infrared cameras</a> which can be used at substantially longer wavelengths, but these are usually not considered as viewers, since they provide an electrical output instead of a directly visible image.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Features of Practical Interest</h2>
<div>
<p>Most infrared viewers are hand-held devices which are battery operated (possibly with rechargeable batteries).
They are hold with a handle, and with one finger one can press a button which turns the image converter on.
By activating it only while needed, one can reach a longer battery life.
(Several hundred hours of continuous operation are often possible.)
Some devices can be fixed to the head of the observer with some facemask, so that hands-free operation becomes possible.
Also, viewers are often mounted in a fixed position, if one always needs to observe the same small area.
Using an external power supply instead of a battery may then be practical.</p>
<p>The obtained image quality depends substantially on the used device and is usually much lower than that of a normal camera for visible light:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The image quality achievable with infrared viewers is normally quite poor, comparing with cameras for visible light.</aside>
<ul>
<li>The image resolution can be relatively poor; even if the objective is properly focused according to the used observation distance.
(When wearing laser safety goggles at the same time, the achieved image quality may be further reduced.)</li>
<li>In addition, some devices exhibit unavoidable black spots in the image.</li>
<li>Also, there are often substantial image distortions, depending on the type of image converter used.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be difficult to judge the transverse intensity profile of a laser beam, for example, if the beam diameter is (as usual) relatively small (e.g. below 1&nbsp;mm).
Therefore, an infrared viewer can never be regarded as a replacement for a <a href="beam_profilers.html" title="devices for measuring the intensity profile of a laser beam">beam profiler</a> camera.</p>
<p>With some viewers, it is possible to attach additional filters to the objective &ndash; for example, for suppressing influences of visible light.
Also, there are close-up lenses, with which one can observe nearby objects with higher <a href="magnification.html" title="the enlargements of images">magnification</a>; that can be useful, for example, when working with <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast to <a href="night_vision_devices.html" title="instruments which allow viewing or imaging under conditions of very low light levels">night vision devices</a>, for infrared viewers in laboratory use it is not common to have binoculars; the usual devices are for one eye only.
It can actually be advantageous to have &ldquo;normal&rdquo; vision with one eye while using a viewer, e.g. because of the very restricted angular range of the viewer.</p>
<p>A low-cost alternative to an infrared viewer can be an <a href="laser_viewing_cards.html" title="cards used for visualizing laser beams in non-visible spectral regions">infrared sensor card</a>; this also allows one to follow a beam path, for example, but is more limited in its application.</p>

<h2>Your Lab is Closed due to the Corona Virus Crisis?</h2>
<p>Time to think how to best utilize your time!</p>
<p>Here is a suggestion: <br> <b>Consider to start with physical modeling!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Build models for your existing or planned lasers and amplifiers, resonators, etc.</li>
<li>Utilize such models in order to <b>improve your qualitative and quantitative understanding</b>, solve problems, optimize device performance and <b>develop new ideas</b>.</li>
<li>Power up your home office instead of wasting your time!</li>
<li>When getting back to the lab, restart with fresh plans and full power.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2009_10_19.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
