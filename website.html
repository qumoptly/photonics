<h1>The RP Photonics Consulting Website</h1>
<h2>Copyright and Responsibility for this Website</h2>
<p><a href="paschotta.html">Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta</a>, RP Photonics Consulting GmbH, Waldstr. 17, 78073 Bad Dürrheim, Germany.</p>
<p>All rights reserved.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: RP Photonics Consulting GmbH is not accepting any legal responsibility for the content of other websites to which links are given, nor to possible errors on this website itself.
However, we would properly deal with any such problems if they come to our attention.</p>
<p>All content on this website has been created and arranged by Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta.</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<aside class="callout red">The website of RP Photonics is one of the most popular websites in the area of photonics &ndash; mostly due to the <a href="encyclopedia.html"><b>RP Photonics Encyclopedia</b></a> and the <a href="buyersguide.html"><b>RP Photonics Buyer's Guide</b></a>.</aside>
<p>Some website owners are trying to obtain the highest possible visibility &ndash; particularly with the Internet <a href="./marketing_glossary.html#search_engine">search engines</a> &ndash; by applying all sorts of trickery in the context of <a href="./marketing_glossary.html#search_engine_optimization">search engine optimization</a> (SEO).
RP Photonics Consulting, on the other hand, is operating its website in a different manner, which is based the conviction that in the long run the honest strategy works best: providing high quality content which makes the website useful for its visitors (&ldquo;content is king&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The <a href="encyclopedia.html">RP Photonics Encyclopedia</a>, which has the honor of being part of the <a href="http://vlib.org/">WWW Virtual Library</a>, is probably the best example for the success of this strategy.</p>
<p>Another important aspect is the users' privacy.
Although we create detailed statistical information on the use of our website, we strictly respect privacy matters.
For more details, see our page on <a href="privacy.html">privacy</a>.</p>
<h2>Technical Remarks</h2>
<p>A number of measures have been taken to ensure that the pages will be correctly displayed with different browsers, avoiding any hassle for users:</p>
<ul>
<li>This website has been designed to comply with the official standard &quot;HTML 5&quot;.
Some optional details are left for preserving backward compatibility with older browsers.</li>
<li>It is occasionally checked with the official <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" rel="nofollow">W3C HTML Validator</a> and tested with various web browsers.</li>
<li>It uses Javascript for various purposes, but can mostly also be used without Javascript, although some convenient features are then not available.</li>
<li>A strict <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/" rel="nofollow">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> has been implemented.
The most important effect of that is to establish an effective second line of defense against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" rel="nofollow">cross-site scripting (XSS)</a> attacks.
Of course, we also try to minimize the risks of XSS intrusions with other means, such as sanitizing input data.</li>
<li>Various other details are also carefully optimized for maximum security, e.g. against hacker attacks.
From <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/" rel="nofollow">Mozilla Observatory</a> we got the security score A<sup>+</sup> (last tested 2020-01-16), while most of our competitors are much worse, often even on the worst possible level F.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>Some customers like to print out certain pages from websites.
Unfortunately, printing from web browsers often doesn't produce nice results.
A useful hint: you may copy content from web pages (including text and images) and paste them into your word processor in order to print them from there.
This often gives better results.</p>
