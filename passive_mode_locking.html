<p>The general aspects of the generation of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> by <a href="mode_locking.html" title="a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode locking</a> are discussed in the article on <a href="mode_locking.html" title="a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode locking</a>.
This article focuses on <em>passive</em> mode locking, which can be achieved by incorporating a <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a> with suitable properties into the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> (Figure&nbsp;1).</p>
<p>Most mode-locked lasers are passively rather than actively mode-locked &ndash; particularly those used for generating very short femtosecond pulses.
However, active mode locking is preferred for some applications where particularly short pulses are not required, but the synchronization with an external electronic signal.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:345px;">
<img src="img/passively_ml_laser.png" alt="mode-locked laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Schematic setup of a laser which is passively mode-locked with a saturable absorber mirror, e.g. a <a href="semiconductor_saturable_absorber_mirrors.html" title="saturable semiconductor absorber devices acting as nonlinear mirrors">SESAM</a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the following, the steady state of a passively mode-locked laser is considered, where a short pulse is already circulating in the laser resonator.
For simplicity, it is assumed that there is a single circulating pulse (i.e. <a href="fundamental_mode_locking.html" title="mode locking with a single pulse circulating in the laser resonator">fundamental</a> rather than <a href="harmonic_mode_locking.html" title="mode locking of a laser where multiple pulses are circulating in the laser resonator with equal temporal spacing">harmonic mode locking</a>), and a <em>fast</em> absorber (see below for details).
Each time the pulse hits the saturable absorber, it saturates the <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a>, thus temporarily reducing the losses (Figure&nbsp;2).
In the steady state, the laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> can be saturated to a level which is just sufficient for compensating the losses for the circulating pulse, whereas any light of lower intensity which hits the absorber at other times will experience losses which are higher than the gain, since the absorber cannot be saturated by this light.
The absorber can thus suppress any additional (weaker) pulses in addition to any continuous background light.
Also, it constantly attenuates particularly the leading wing of the circulating pulse; the trailing wing may also be attenuated if the absorber can recover sufficiently quickly (see below).
The absorber thus tends to decrease the pulse duration; in the steady state, this effect will balance other effects (e.g. <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>) which tend to lengthen the pulse.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/passive_mode_locking_fast.png" alt="passive mode locking with fast absorber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Temporal evolution of optical power and losses in a passively mode-locked laser with a fast saturable absorber.
The shorter the pulse becomes, the faster will be the loss modulation.
The gain stays approximately constant, as gain saturation is weak.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Compared with <a href="active_mode_locking.html" title="a technique of mode locking, based on active modulation of the intracavity losses or the round-trip phase change">active mode locking</a>, the technique of passive mode locking allows the generation of much shorter pulses, essentially because a saturable absorber, driven by already very short pulses, can modulate the resonator losses much faster than any electronic modulator: the shorter the circulating pulse becomes, the faster is the loss modulation obtained.
This holds at least for the leading wing of the pulse, where the absorber is bleached, whereas absorber recovery may take some longer time.</p>
<p>In many (but not all) cases, the saturable absorber can also start the mode-locking process.
If the pulse generation process begins automatically after switching on the laser, this is called <a href="self_starting_mode_locking.html" title="mode locking which is quickly achieved after turning on a laser, without external intervention"><em>self-starting mode locking</em></a>.
Usually, the laser first starts operation in a more or less <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous</a> way, but with significant fluctuations of the laser power (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase"><em>laser noise</em></a>).
In each resonator round trip, the saturable absorber will then favor the light which has somewhat higher intensities, because this light can saturate the absorption slightly more than light with lower intensities.
After many round trips, a single pulse will remain (principle of &ldquo;the winner takes all&rdquo;).
However, self-starting is not always achieved.
Generally, slow absorbers are more suitable for self-starting mode locking than fast absorbers.
For example, <a href="kerr_lens_mode_locking.html" title="a technique for mode locking a laser, exploiting nonlinear self-focusing">Kerr lens mode-locked</a> lasers are often not self-starting; they run in <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> mode after turning on, and start mode locking only when the user knocks against a resonator mirror.
Self-starting may be inhibited e.g. by parasitic reflections in the resonator, by mode pulling effects (which can be related to, e.g., <a href="spatial_hole_burning.html" title="a distortion of the gain shape in a laser medium (or the loss spectrum in a saturable absorber medium), caused by saturation effects of a standing wave">spatial hole burning</a> in the gain medium), or by <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fast and Slow Saturable Absorbers</h2>
<div>
<p>If the absorber recovery time is well below the pulse duration, the absorber is called a <em>fast absorber</em>.
In that case, the loss modulation basically follows the variation of the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
However, mode locking can also be achieved with a <em>slow absorber</em>, having a recovery time above the pulse duration (see Figure&nbsp;3).</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/passive_mode_locking_slow.png" alt="passive mode locking">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Temporal evolution of optical power and losses in a passively mode-locked laser with a slow saturable absorber.
The saturable absorber causes a loss modulation which is fast for the leading wing of the pulse, whereas recovery of the absorber takes some longer time.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It turns out that e.g. in a <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state laser</a> mode-locked with a slow absorber, there is a temporal range with net gain just after the pulses, where the absorber is still in the saturated state.
One would normally expect that such a situation can not be stable, because any noise behind the pulse should exhibit exponential growth of its energy, sooner or later destabilizing the pulse.
However, both experimental observations and <a href="pulse_propagation_modeling.html" title="working with physical models describing the propagation of ultrashort pulses e.g. in lasers or optical fibers">numerical simulations</a> indicate stability even in situations where the absorber recovery time is more than an order of magnitude longer than the pulse duration.
An explanation for that mystery was first found in the case of <a href="soliton_mode_locking.html" title="a mechanism for laser mode locking based on soliton pulses">soliton mode locking</a> [13], but unexpected stability had been observed also in simple cases without dispersive and nonlinear effects; that could also be demonstrated with numerical simulations.
Finally, in 2001 a subtle mechanism was found to be responsible for the stability [16]: the stronger absorption for the leading edge of the pulse constantly delays the pulse (i.e. shifts the position of the maximum), but not the noise background, so that the latter has a limited time for exponential growth.
Based on that analysis, a limit for the allowable absorber recovery time could be derived.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Types of Saturable Absorbers</h2>
<div>
<p>The crucial intracavity component for passive mode locking is a <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a>.
The most important type of absorber for passive mode locking is the <a href="semiconductor_saturable_absorber_mirrors.html" title="saturable semiconductor absorber devices acting as nonlinear mirrors">semiconductor saturable absorber mirror</a>, called SESAM.
This is a compact semiconductor device, the parameters of which can be adjusted in very wide ranges, so that appropriately designed SESAMs can be used to mode-lock very different kinds of lasers, in particular <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>, including different kinds of <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a>.
(See also the article on <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>.)</p>
<p>Other saturable absorbers for mode locking are based on <a href="quantum_dots.html" title="microscopic structures confining charge carriers in three dimensions">quantum dots</a>, e.g. of lead sulfide (PbS) suspended in glasses.
Doped-insulator saturable absorbers, as often used for passive <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a> (e.g. Cr:YAG), usually have a too slow recovery for mode locking.</p>
<p>There are also various kinds of <em>artificial saturable absorbers</em>, based on, e.g., <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear</a> <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> shifts (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="kerr_lens_mode_locking.html" title="a technique for mode locking a laser, exploiting nonlinear self-focusing"><em>Kerr lens mode locking</em></a>, <a href="additive_pulse_mode_locking.html" title="a technique for mode locking a laser, using a nonlinear interaction in an external resonator"><em>additive-pulse mode locking</em></a>, <a href="nonlinear_polarization_rotation.html" title="the phenomenon that the change in the polarization direction of light in a fiber can depend on the optical intensity"><em>nonlinear polarization rotation</em></a>) or on intensity-dependent <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">frequency conversion</a> (<em>nonlinear mirror mode locking</em> [9]).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Dispersion and Nonlinearities</h2>
<div>
<p>In the picosecond regime of pulse durations, <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> usually has only a weak effect.
<a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">Nonlinearities</a>, in particular the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr effect</a>, can be significant, depending on parameters such as the length and material of the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>, the mode area at that place, and the pulse energy and duration.</p>
<p>For femtosecond pulse generation, it is usually required to arrange for <a href="dispersion_compensation.html" title="the control of the overall chromatic dispersion of a system by adding optical elements with a suitable amount of dispersion">dispersion compensation</a>, for example with a <a href="prism_pairs.html" title="combinations of two prisms, mostly used for dispersion compensation">prism pair</a>, as shown in the article on <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>, or with <a href="dispersive_mirrors.html" title="mirrors which provide some amount of chromatic dispersion for the reflected beam">dispersive mirrors</a>.
In many cases, a laser is operated in the anomalous dispersion regime, where the circulating pulse can be a quasi-<a href="solitons.html" title="pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects">soliton</a>; this is called <a href="soliton_mode_locking.html" title="a mechanism for laser mode locking based on soliton pulses"><em>soliton mode locking</em></a>.
In the few-cycle pulse duration regime, with ultrabroad pulse spectra, precise compensation of higher-order dispersion is required.</p>
<p>The effects of nonlinearities, in particular of the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr nonlinearity</a>, can also be very important in femtosecond lasers.
Excessive nonlinear phase shifts can destabilize the pulses or limit the achievable pulse durations.
On the other hand, they can play a useful role in soliton mode locking.
In <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>, the fiber nonlinearity is often stronger than desirable and thus often limits the achievable pulse durations and/or pulse energies.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Mechanisms of Pulse Formation and Shaping</h2>
<div>
<p>In the steady state of a mode-locked laser, the pulse parameters are essentially constant, or at least are reproduced after each resonator round trips.
This means that there must be a balance of all effects acting on the pulse.
The details of this balance, i.e., the importance of various effects and even the whole principle of pulse formation, can depend strongly on the type of laser and the pulse duration regime, not only on the type of saturable absorber.
Some examples are discussed in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">Gain saturation</a> during the pulse can be significant in <a href="dye_lasers.html" title="lasers based on liquid or solid dyes as gain media">dye lasers</a> and <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a>, but not at all in <a href="doped_insulator_lasers.html" title="lasers with a solid-state gain medium containing a laser-active dopant">doped-insulator</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>.
In the former cases, significant <a href="chirp.html" title="time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirp</a> of the pulses can be a consequence.
Also, stabilization of the <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a> by gain saturation is strong in <a href="dye_lasers.html" title="lasers based on liquid or solid dyes as gain media">dye lasers</a> and <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a>, but very weak in <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr effect</a> and the effect of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> can be negligible in <a href="picosecond_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting pulses with picosecond durations">picosecond lasers</a>, particularly for those with multi-gigahertz repetition rates, but very strong in <a href="femtosecond_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting light pulses with durations between a few femtoseconds and hundreds of femtoseconds">femtosecond lasers</a>, particularly in <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>.
Both can play a very useful role in <a href="soliton_mode_locking.html" title="a mechanism for laser mode locking based on soliton pulses">soliton mode-locked lasers</a>, whereas much smaller nonlinear phase shifts can have a destabilizing effect in lasers without intracavity <a href="dispersion.html" title="the dependence of the phase velocity in a medium on the optical frequency or the propagation mode">dispersion</a>.</li>
<li>In some mode-locked lasers, the pulse duration obtained depends strongly on the parameters of the saturable absorber.
For others (e.g. soliton mode-locked lasers), this influence can be weak, because the absorber plays only a stabilizing role, but is not dominant for pulse shaping.</li>
</ul>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of the pulse formation and shaping processes is essential for good <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a>, with which the best possible performance is achieved.
For the detailed study of pulse shaping in mode-locked lasers, numerical <a href="pulse_propagation_modeling.html" title="working with physical models describing the propagation of ultrashort pulses e.g. in lasers or optical fibers">pulse propagation modeling</a> can be very useful.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Achievable Pulse Duration</h2>
<div>
<p>Depending on the particular type of mode-locked laser, the shortest achievable <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> can be determined by a number of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>In simple SESAM mode-locked lasers particularly in the picosecond regime, the pulse duration often results from a steady state between <a href="gain_narrowing.html" title="the phenomenon that the bandwidth of light can be reduced during amplification in a medium with a limited gain bandwidth">gain narrowing</a> and the pulse-shortening effect of the SESAM absorber, which itself depends on details such as <a href="modulation_depth.html" title="a relative modulation amplitude, or (for a saturable absorber) the maximum change in absorption">modulation depth</a> and degree of saturation.
The pulse duration is then inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of round-trip gain and modulation depth [16], also inversely proportional to the gain bandwidth.</li>
<li>In the femtosecond regime, the situation is usually further complicated by the influence of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>.
A common technique is (quasi-)<a href="soliton_mode_locking.html" title="a mechanism for laser mode locking based on soliton pulses">soliton mode locking</a>, where the pulse duration is largely determined by the balance of dispersion and <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr nonlinearity</a>, without a significant direct influence of the <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a>.
The pulse duration can then be reduced by reducing the amount of anomalous intracavity dispersion, provided that the circulating pulse stays stable.
The stability limit and thus the achievable pulse duration depends on the gain bandwidth, but also on the total intracavity losses, the strength of <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> and other factors.</li>
<li>In <a href="mode_locked_fiber_lasers.html" title="ultrafast fiber lasers which are actively or passively mode-locked for generating ultrashort pulses">mode-locked fiber lasers</a>, often utilizing more complicated pulse formation mechanisms, the achievable pulse duration may also be strongly influenced by nonlinearities and by higher-order <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The shortest pulses generated directly with a passively mode-locked laser have durations around 5.5&nbsp;fs (see the article on <a href="ultrafast_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting ultrashort pulses">ultrafast lasers</a>).
External <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compression</a> allows for significant further reductions.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Instabilities</h2>
<div>
<p>The use of a saturable absorber in a laser may not only lead to passive mode locking, but also to passive <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>, to <a href="q_switched_mode_locking.html" title="an operation regime of mode-locked lasers with strong fluctuations of the pulse energy">Q-switched mode locking</a>, or to some noisy <a href="modes_of_laser_operation.html" title="a mode of operation such as continuous-wave operation, Q-switched or mode-locked operation">mode of operation</a>, if the absorber properties are not appropriate.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, <a href="q_switching_instabilities.html" title="instabilities of passively mode-locked lasers where the pulse energy is unstable">Q-switching instabilities</a> can occur, because the saturable absorber usually &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; any increase in the intracavity <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a> above its steady-state value with reduced losses, so that the net gain becomes positive and the pulse energy can rise further.
The situation becomes unstable if <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a> is not strong enough to counteract the destabilizing effect of the absorber.
Q-switching instabilities (or <a href="q_switched_mode_locking.html" title="an operation regime of mode-locked lasers with strong fluctuations of the pulse energy">Q-switched mode locking</a>) can usually be suppressed by observing certain design guidelines, but in certain parameter ranges &ndash; for high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a>, in particularly in combination with short pulses or high output powers &ndash; this can be challenging.</p>
<p>There is also a range of other types of instabilities, which can be related e.g. to excessive <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>, to an inappropriate degree of absorber saturation, to too slow absorber recovery, to higher-order <a href="dispersion.html" title="the dependence of the phase velocity in a medium on the optical frequency or the propagation mode">dispersion</a>, to parasitic reflections, or to <a href="inhomogeneous_saturation.html" title="gain saturation effects which alter the shape of the gain spectrum">inhomogeneous gain saturation</a>.
It is not always obvious which of these instabilities is at work, but the required measures usually depend strongly on that.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optimum Design</h2>
<div>
<p>Optimum <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">design</a> of a mode-locked laser, particularly for operation in extreme parameter regions, must be based on a thorough understanding of the relations between various parameters and effects occurring in such lasers.
Figure&nbsp;4 shows such relations for passively mode-locked lasers in a very simplified form.
For example, a high <a href="modulation_depth.html" title="a relative modulation amplitude, or (for a saturable absorber) the maximum change in absorption">modulation depth</a> <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&Delta;</span><i>R</i></span> of the saturable absorber (<a href="semiconductor_saturable_absorber_mirrors.html" title="saturable semiconductor absorber devices acting as nonlinear mirrors">SESAM</a>) normally leads to shorter pulses, but also to an increased tendency for <a href="q_switching_instabilities.html" title="instabilities of passively mode-locked lasers where the pulse energy is unstable">Q-switching instabilities</a> or <a href="q_switched_mode_locking.html" title="an operation regime of mode-locked lasers with strong fluctuations of the pulse energy">Q-switched mode locking</a>, and to a reduced power efficiency.
Q-switching instabilities are related in various ways to SESAM <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage</a>, and can be suppressed in various ways.
A thorough understanding of all these relations often allows one to &ldquo;shift&rdquo; the problems to a location where they are much more easily solved.
For example, SESAM damage issues, which originally sometimes occurred even for fairly moderate output powers, have been solved essentially not by developing SESAMs with higher damage thresholds, but rather by optimizing the overall laser design.
This allowed the generation of very high output powers [19] without putting the SESAM under excessive stress.</p>

Simplified sketch of the relations between various parameters and effects in a passively mode-locked laser.
Red arrows indicate positive relations (more of X leads to more of Y), whereas blue arrows represent negative relations.
A comprehensive understanding of all these relations is required for good laser design, particularly for operation in extreme parameter regions.
