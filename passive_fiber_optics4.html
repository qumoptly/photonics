<h2 class="togglediv">Part 4: Multimode Fibers</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:245px;">
<img src="img/fiber_core.png" alt="core of single-mode and multimode fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A single-mode fiber (left) has a core which is very small compared with the cladding, whereas a multimode fiber (right) can have a large core.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">Multimode fibers</a> are fibers having multiple guided modes at the operation wavelength &ndash; sometimes only a few (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="few_mode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting only few guided modes">few-mode fibers</a>), but often many.
The <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> is often quite large &ndash; not much smaller than the whole fiber (see Figure&nbsp;1).
At the same time, the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> is often relatively high &ndash; for example, 0.3.
This combination leads to a large <a href="v_number.html" title="a normalized frequency parameter, which determines the number of modes of a step-index fiber"><em>V</em> number</a>, which in turn leads to a large number of modes.
For <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index fibers</a> with large <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i></span>, it can be estimated with the following formula, when counting both polarization directions:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/v_no_modes.gif" width="57" height="44" alt="number of modes versus V number"></div>
<p>Fibers with a smaller number of guided modes, e.g. with V numbers between 3 and 10, are sometimes called <a href="few_mode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting only few guided modes"><em>few-mode fibers</em></a>.</p>
<p>Multimode fibers are required, if light with poor spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> needs to be transported.
For example, this is the case for the output of typical high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>, such as <a href="diode_bars.html" title="a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a>.
Whereas only a tiny portion of their output power could be launched into a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>, very efficient launching is possible for a multimode fiber with sufficiently large core and/or high NA.
Another example is the use of <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diodes</a> (LEDs) instead of <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> as cheap signal sources in <a href="fiber_optic_links.html" title="optical communication links where the signal light is transported in fibers">fiber-optic links</a>.
Other applications exist imaging, for example; the transmission of image information requires devices with many spatial modes.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Specifications for Multimode Fibers</h3>
<div>
<p>A basic specification of a multimode fiber contains the core diameter and the outer diameter of a multimode fiber.
Common <a href="telecom_fibers.html" title="optical fibers for use in optical fiber communications">telecom fibers</a> (fibers for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> over moderate distances) are 50/125&nbsp;&mu;m and 62.5/125&nbsp;&mu;m fibers, having a core diameter of 50&nbsp;&mu;m or 62.5&nbsp;&mu;m, respectively, and a cladding diameter of 125&nbsp;&mu;m.
Such fibers support hundreds of guided modes.
<a href="large_core_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large fiber core">Large-core fibers</a> with even substantially larger core diameters of hundreds of micrometers are also available.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Launching Light into a Multimode Fiber</h3>
<div>
<aside class="textbox tb_right redmargin" style=" width:215px;">
<h2>Software for Calculating Launch Efficiencies</h2>
<p>Our software <a href="rp_fiber_calculator.html"><b>RP Fiber Calculator</b></a> can calculate the launch efficiency of a misaligned Gaussian laser beam.
It tells you how much power gets into each mode.</p>
<p>For more comprehensive calculations, e.g. for arbitrary input beam profiles, our <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a> software is the ideal tool.</p>
</aside>
<p>Compared with a single-mode fiber, a multimode fiber allows for much easier launching of light, particularly if it supports many guided modes.
For efficient launching, one has to fulfill two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The input light should essentially only hit the core, not the cladding.</li>
<li class="ta_left">The input light should not contain significant amounts of power propagating with angles larger than arcsin NA.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <a href="m2_factor.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a> of the input light is sufficiently small, it is possible to fulfill these two conditions simultaneously.
The maximum <a href="m2_factor.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a> for efficient launching of a beam with super-Gaussian profile can be estimated from the following formula:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/m2_max_mm.gif" width="144" height="26" alt="maximum M2 for launching into a multimode fiber"></div>
<p>This is actually the approximate beam quality factor from the fiber if the optical power is well spread over all modes.
(The estimate is accurate only if the fiber has many guided modes.)
Of course, efficient launching does not only require a low enough <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor, but also a suitable shape of the intensity profile in real space and Fourier space.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a fiber with 25&nbsp;&mu;m core radius and a <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> of 0.2.
Figure&nbsp;2 shows the intensity profile of a <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> input beam at 1000&nbsp;nm, which has been numerically constructed such that it just fills the fiber core and also has an angular distribution which reaches out up to the limit set by the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> of the fiber.
The beam profile was essentially made by starting with a super-Gaussian intensity profile with entirely random phase values (leading to a huge divergence), then filtering with another super-Gaussian function in the Fourier domain, and once again applying the super-Gaussian filter in the spatial domain.</p>
<p>The angular distribution leads to the complicated intensity variations.
Much smoother intensity profiles for the same beam quality are possible for non-monochromatic beams: although each wavelength component has a complicated profile, the fluctuations of these can average out to a smooth overall profile.
(Particularly for non-monochromatic beams, a smooth intensity profile does <em>not</em> indicate a high beam quality.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/launch_to_mm_fiber1.png" alt="input beam profile">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Intensity profile of a <a href="multimode_beams.html" title="light beams in free space or in transparent media which involve multiple (often many) modes, frequently with highly random characteristics">multimode beam</a> which has about the maximum possible <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> value for efficient launching into the fiber.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The constructed beam turns out to have an <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> value of 12, which is not far below the limit of 15.7 as calculated from the formula mentioned above.
Figure&nbsp;3 shows how it propagates in the fiber.
The beam profile undergoes strong changes in the fiber, but nearly all of the light stays guided.</p>

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Similar simulations exhibit substantial launch losses if the initial beam size or the angular range is further expanded.
Also, efficient launching requires a somewhat lower <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> value (below 10) if the beam profile is roughly Gaussian rather than super-Gaussian.</p>
<p>If one would launch light into specific high-order modes, that light could have a roughly 2 times larger <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> value than according to the formula above.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Output Beam Profiles</h3>
<div>
<aside class="textbox tb_right redmargin" style=" width:215px;">
<h2>Software for Calculating Beam Propagation</h2>
<p>Our software <a href="rp_fiber_calculator.html"><b>RP Fiber Calculator</b></a> can calculate the light propagation in fibers based on the calculated core modes.</p>
<p>The more sophisticated product <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a> also offers full numerical beam propagation.</p>
</aside>
<p>The output beam profile from a multimode fiber depends on the launch conditions.
In addition, it depends sensitively on the conditions (bending, temperature, etc.) of the whole fiber.
This is because such effects influence the <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&beta;</span></span> values of all the modes, and therefore the <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> conditions.
Over a long length of fiber, even tiny changes of <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&beta;</span></span> values can have pronounced effects.</p>
<p>Multimode fibers are sometimes used for <a href="beam_homogenizers.html" title="devices for producing beam profiles with homogeneous intensity distribution">beam homogenization</a>, i.e., for obtaining a smoother intensity profile.
That works well, however, only for <a href="polychromatic_light.html" title="light with multiple optical frequencies">polychromatic light</a>, where the profiles for different frequency components average out.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Single-mode Propagation in Multimode Fibers</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout green">Under which circumstances can be we have single-mode propagation in a multimode fiber?</aside>
<p>If one launches light entirely into the fundamental mode of a multimode fiber, the beam profile should in principle stay unchanged during propagation.
One would then obtain an output with high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, similar to that of a single-mode fiber.
However, various kinds of disturbances may lead to <a href="mode_coupling.html" title="a concept for describing and calculating light propagation in certain situations, e.g. involving nonlinear interactions">mode coupling</a>: some light may be coupled into higher-order modes, so that the beam quality can be spoiled.</p>
<p>Fortunately, such coupling effects are often not that strong.
As an example, consider a step-index fiber with 20&nbsp;&mu;m core diameter and an NA of 0.1.
This is a few-mode fiber, supporting 6 guided modes (when counting all mode orientations).
We take a 10&nbsp;mm long piece of that fiber and introduce a relatively sharp bend, where the inverse bend radius rises smoothly to 1 / (10&nbsp;mm) in the middle and back to zero again.
That bending causes a substantial shift and deformation of the mode profile in the middle of the fiber:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/sm_prop_in_mm_fiber2.png" alt="shifted beam profile due to bending of fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
The beam profile in the middle of a bent fiber is substantially shifted away from the center of the core.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Nevertheless, at the fiber end, where the bending has ended, the original beam profile is nearly unchanged; virtually all power remains in the LP<sub>01</sub> mode:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/sm_prop_in_mm_fiber1.png" alt="beam propagation in a bent multimode fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;5:</span> 
Evolution of beam profile in a fiber which is bent in the middle part only.
(The spatial coordinates do not reflect the bending, which is simulated as a linear addition to the index profile; one sees only the shift of the mode profile as a consequence of the bending.)
The beam profile nicely comes back to the original position at the fiber end.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One may wonder why essentially no light is coupled into higher-order modes despite the strong bending effect.
For this we need to consider the difference in phase constants for the LP<sub>01</sub> and LP<sub>11</sub> modes, for example, which is as high as 4.5&nbsp;rad/mm.
That phase mismatch effectively suppresses the coupling: the amplitude contributions coupled from the fundamental mode to some higher-order mode in different parts of the fiber will overall largely cancel each other.</p>
<p>For fibers with large mode areas, the <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&beta;</span></span> values of different modes come much closer.
Therefore, the beat length of two modes is much longer, and even relatively slowly changing disturbances can effectively couple modes.
It is therefore more difficult in large mode area few-mode fibers to preserve single-mode propagation.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Graded-index Fibers</h3>
<div>
<p>For telecom applications, it is sometimes desirable to minimize the <a href="intermodal_dispersion.html" title="the phenomenon that the group velocity of light propagating in a waveguide structure depends on the waveguide mode">intermodal dispersion</a>, i.e., the width of the range of <a href="group_velocity.html" title="the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium">group velocities</a>.
This leads to reduced temporal spreading and distortion of telecom signals and thus allows for higher data rates.</p>
<p>Step-index fibers are not good in this respect.
It has been found that <a href="graded_index_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with a continuously varying refractive index in the radial dimension">graded-index fibers</a> with a close to parabolic index profile are much better suited for such applications.
Figure&nbsp;6 shows such an index profile.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/graded_index_fiber1.png" alt="graded index profile">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;6:</span> 
Refractive index profile of a graded-index fiber, which is parabolic in the core region. The effective refractive indices of the guided modes (shown as gray lines) are equally spaced.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In an intuitive picture, one may consider that rays oscillating around the fiber axis have a longer path length than a ray going straight through, but that this can be compensated by a lower refractive index in the outer regions which the oscillating rays see.
Such vagues ideas, however, are often quite misleading.
For example, they may create the expectation that higher-order fiber modes, having increased transverse wave vector components, experience larger phase delays in fibers, while the opposite is true.
Therefore, we recommend to use such ideas with care and skepticism.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;7 shows a simulation, where a Gaussian input beam has been somewhat displaced against the center of the fiber core.
In the fiber, the intensity profile oscillates without fully reaching the edges of the core region.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/graded_index_fiber2.png" alt="beam propagation in a graded-index fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;7:</span> 
Beam propagation in a graded-index fiber, where a Gaussian input beam has been slightly offset against the center of the fiber core.
The horizontal gray lines indicate the edges of the core.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For comparison, Figure&nbsp;8 shows the same for a step-index design with the same core radius and maximum refractive index.
The result looks quite different.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure&nbsp;9 shows one point for each mode of the graded-index fiber, where the coordinates represent the mode area and the group velocity.
One can see that the group velocities are nearly the same for all modes, whereas the effective mode areas span a large range.</p>
