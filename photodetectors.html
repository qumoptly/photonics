<p>Photodetectors are devices used for the detection of light &ndash; in most cases of <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a>.
More specifically, photodetectors are usually understood as <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> detectors, which in some way utilize the photo-excitation of electric carriers; <a href="thermal_detectors.html" title="light detectors which are based on measuring light-induced temperature rises">thermal detectors</a> are then not included by the term, and are also not treated in this article.</p>
<p>Photodetectors usually deliver an electronic output signal &ndash; for example, a voltage or electric current which is proportional to the incident <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
They are thus belonging to the area of <a href="optoelectronics.html" title="the technology of electronic devices that interact with light">optoelectronics</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Types of Photodetectors</h2>
<div>
<p>As the requirements for applications (see below) vary considerably, there are many types of photodetectors which may be appropriate in a particular case:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light"><em>Photodiodes</em></a> are semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n junction or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure (i = intrinsic material) (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="p_i_n_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with a p&ndash;i&ndash;n semiconductor structure"><em>p&ndash;i&ndash;n photodiodes</em></a>), where light is absorbed in a depletion region and generates a <a href="photocurrent.html" title="an electric current which is induced by incident light in a photodetector">photocurrent</a>.
Such devices can be very compact, fast, highly linear, and exhibit a high quantum efficiency (i.e., generate nearly one electron per incident <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a>) and a high dynamic range, provided that they are operated in combination with suitable electronics.
A particularly sensitive type is that of <a href="avalanche_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with internal signal amplification through an avalanche process"><em>avalanche photodiodes</em></a>, which are sometimes used even for <a href="photon_counting.html" title="photodetection at low light levels where single photon absorption events are counted">photon counting</a>.</li>
<li><a href="metal_semiconductor_metal_photodetectors.html" title="fast photodetector devices based on metal&ndash;semiconductor (Schottky) contacts"><em>Metal&ndash;semiconductor&ndash;metal (MSM) photodetectors</em></a> contain two Schottky contacts instead of a p&ndash;n junction.
They are potentially faster than photodiodes, with <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidths</a> up to hundreds of gigahertz.</li>
<li><a href="phototransistors.html" title="a type of semiconductor-based photodetector with internal current amplification for higher responsivity"><em>Phototransistors</em></a> are similar to photodiodes, but exploit internal amplification of the photocurrent.
They are less frequently used than photodiodes.</li>
<li><a href="photoconductive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which exhibit a reduction in electrical resistance caused by incoming light"><em>Photoconductive detectors</em></a> are also based on certain semiconductors, e.g. cadmium sulfide (CdS).
They are cheaper than photodiodes, but they are fairly slow, are not very sensitive, and exhibit a nonlinear response.
On the other hand, they can respond to long-wavelength infrared light.</li>
<li><a href="phototubes.html" title="gas-filled or vacuum tubes which can be used as photodetectors"><em>Phototubes</em></a> are vacuum tubes or gas-filled tubes where the <a href="photoelectric_effect.html" title="the emission or excitation of electric carriers related to the absorption of light">photoelectric effect</a> is exploited (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="photoemissive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which are based on the external photoelectric effect"><em>photoemissive detectors</em></a>).</li>
<li><a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons"><em>Photomultipliers</em></a> are a special kind of phototubes, based on vacuum tubes.
They can exhibit the combination of an extremely high sensitivity (even for <a href="photon_counting.html" title="photodetection at low light levels where single photon absorption events are counted">photon counting</a>) with a high speed and large active area.
Some of them are based on multichannel plates; they can be substantially more compact than traditional photomultipliers.</li>
<li>Research is performed on novel photodetectors based on carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene, which can offer a very broad wavelength range and a very fast response.
Ways for integrating such devices into optoelectronic chips are explored.</li>
</ul>
<p>These devices are all based on the internal or external <a href="photoelectric_effect.html" title="the emission or excitation of electric carriers related to the absorption of light">photoelectric effect</a>; <a href="photoemissive_detectors.html" title="photodetectors which are based on the external photoelectric effect">photoemissive detectors</a> belong to the latter category.</p>
<p>Various kinds of photodetectors can be integrated into devices like <a href="optical_power_meters.html" title="instruments for optical power measurements, based e.g. on heating of an absorber structure or a photodiode">power meters</a> and <a href="optical_power_monitors.html" title="devices for monitoring optical powers in free-space light beams or in optical fibers">optical power monitors</a>.
Others can be made in the form of large two-dimensional arrays, e.g. for <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> applications.
They may be called <a href="focal_plane_arrays.html" title="arrays of light detectors placed in the focal plane of an imaging system"><em>focal plane arrays</em></a>.
For example, there are <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">CCD and CMOS sensors</a> which are used mainly in <a href="cameras.html" title="optical instruments for recording still or moving images">cameras</a>.</p>
<p>See also the article on <a href="terahertz_detectors.html" title="detectors for terahertz radiation">terahertz detectors</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Important Properties of Photodetectors</h2>
<div>
<p>Depending on the application, a photodetector has to fulfill various requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be sensitive in some given spectral region (range of optical wavelengths).
In some cases, the <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> should be constant or at least well defined within some wavelength range.
It can also be important to have zero response in some other wavelength range; an example are <a href="solar_blind_photodetectors.html" title="photodetectors which are insensitive to visible light but react to ultraviolet light"><em>solar-blind photodetectors</em></a>, being sensitive only to short-wavelength <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> but not to sun light.</li>
<li>The detector must be suitable for some range of optical powers.
The maximum detected power can be limited e.g. by <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage</a> issues or by a nonlinear response, whereas the minimum power is normally determined by noise.
The magnitude of the dynamic range (typically specified as the ratio of maximum and minimum detectable power, e.g. in <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a>) is often most important.
Some detectors (e.g. photodiodes) can exhibit high linearity over a dynamic range of more than 70&nbsp;dB.</li>
<li>In some cases, not only a high <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a>, but also a high <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a> is important, as otherwise additional <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a> is introduced.
This applies e.g. to the detection of <a href="squeezed_states_of_light.html" title="nonclassical states of light with noise below the standard quantum limit in one quadrature component">squeezed states of light</a>, and also affects the photon detection probability of single-photon detectors.</li>
<li>The active area of a detector can be important e.g. when working with strongly divergent beams from <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>.
For light sources with very high and/or non-constant <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, it is hardly possible to get all the light onto the active area.
An <a href="integrating_spheres.html" title="devices with a diffusely reflecting inner surface, used for certain optical measurements">integrating sphere</a> may then be used (with appropriate calibration) for measuring the total power.</li>
<li>The detection <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> may begin at 0&nbsp;Hz or some finite frequency (for AC-coupled detectors), and ends at some maximum frequency which may be limited by internal processes (e.g. the speed of electric carriers in a semiconductor material) or by the involved electronics (e.g. introducing some RC time constants).
Some resonant detectors operate only in a narrow frequency range, and can be suitable e.g. for lock-in detection.</li>
<li>Some detectors (such as pyroelectric detectors) are suitable only for detecting <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a>, not for continuous-wave light.</li>
<li>For detecting pulses (possibly on a few-<a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> level), the timing precision may be of interest.
Some detectors have a certain &ldquo;dead time&rdquo; after the detection of a pulse, where they are not sensitive.</li>
<li>Different types of detectors require more or less complex electronics.
Penalties in terms of size and cost may result e.g. from the requirement of applying a high voltage or detecting extremely small voltages.</li>
<li>Particularly some mid-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> detectors need to be cooled to fairly low temperatures.
This makes their use under various circumstances impractical.</li>
<li>For some applications, one-dimensional or two-dimensional <em>photodetector arrays</em> are needed &ndash; most often in the form of <a href="photodiode_arrays.html" title="typically linear arrays of photodiodes, provided as compact devices">photodiode arrays</a>.
For detector arrays, some different aspects come into play, such as cross-pixel interference and read-out techniques.</li>
<li>Finally, the size, robustness and cost are essential for many applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different detector types, as listed above, differ very much in many of these properties.
In typical application scenarios, some requirements totally rule out the use of certain detector types, and quickly lead to a fairly limited choice.
Note also that there are some typical trade-offs.
For example, it is frequently difficult to combine a high detection bandwidth with a high sensitivity.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of Photodetectors</h2>
<div>
<p>Photodetectors have a very wide range of applications.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="radiometry.html" title="the science and technology of measuring properties of electromagnetic radiation, including light">radiometry</a> and <a href="photometry.html" title="the science and technology of measuring properties of light related to its perceived brightness for human eyes">photometry</a>, they can be used for measuring properties like <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>, <a href="luminous_flux.html" title="a measure of the perceived power of light, e.g. from a light source">luminous flux</a>, <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a> and <a href="irradiance.html" title="the radiant flux (optical power) received by a surface per unit area">irradiance</a>, in conjunction with additional means also for properties like the <a href="radiance.html" title="the optical power per unit area and solid angle">radiance</a>.</li>

To achieve this, we use a proprietary epitaxial design and receiver configuration that allows independent optimization of the above parameters. The devices are optimized to work in RF over fiber links that require high dynamic range, low noise figure and high RF gain. The packaged components are soldered and laser welded, ensuring maximum physical reliability and performance stability with ambient temperature variation. We currently offer different configurations of receivers in the frequency range from DC to 40&nbsp;GHz with a K-connector RF output. Some models include an internal 50 Ohm impedance which obviates the need for a bias T. APIC also offers a surface-mount 20-GHz PD with a 50 Ohm internal impedance.</p></aside>
