<p>The term optical spectroscopy denotes methods where the interaction of <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> with matter is utilized.
Usually, the strength of some interaction is measured as a function of the <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> or <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>; i.e., the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> plays an important role.</p>
<p>This article deals only with optical spectroscopy; there are various other areas such as particle spectroscopy.</p>
<p>The purpose of spectroscopy is often to detect certain substances or to measure their properties.
For example, gas spectroscopy is often used for measuring the concentrations of trace gases or the temperatures of gases.
In other cases, known properties of substances are used for the purposes, e.g. for realizing <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules">optical frequency standards</a>.
The term <em>spectrometry</em> instead of <em>spectroscopy</em> is sometimes used in order to emphasize that certain quantities are measured in a quantitative manner.</p>
<p>There exists a very wide range of very different spectroscopic methods; this article can give only a course overview.
Many of the modern spectroscopic methods involve one or several <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> and are then called <a href="laser_spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of laser light with matter is utilized"><em>laser spectroscopy</em></a>.
Due to the enormous potentials of lasers in terms of temporal and spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>, narrow <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> and <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tunability</a>, <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> (particularly <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a>), <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a> generation etc., the field of spectroscopy has been widened very substantially since the advent of lasers.
Even before that time, spectroscopy has delivered invaluable insight into many phenomena; for example, it allowed researchers to study the interior of the sun and discover helium there, even before it was found on earth.</p>
<p>See also the more specific articles on <a href="laser_spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of laser light with matter is utilized">laser spectroscopy</a> and <a href="laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="methods of absorption spectroscopy using laser light">laser absorption spectroscopy</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Exploited Physical Effects</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Absorption of Light</h3>
<div>
<p>Different interactions between light and matter can be utilized in spectroscopy.
The most commonly used interaction is the <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> of light (&rarr;&nbsp;<em>absorption spectroscopy</em>).
For example, atoms and molecules exhibit distinct absorption features, so that different atoms or molecules can easily be distinguished if the absorption versus wavelength is measured.
Particularly in the mid-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region, molecules have relatively strong and narrow absorption lines related to their vibrational and rotational modes.
This allows one to detect a wide range of substances with a very high sensitivity.
An example for an application is the detection of tiny concentrations of air pollutants.</p>
<p>As molecules can have many different absorption lines, some of which may overlap for different species, detection of a single line is often not sufficient for discriminating between different molecules.
Recording the absorption spectrum for some sufficiently wide wavelength range, however, often results in a clear spectroscopic finger print.
One may also distinguish different isotopes.</p>
<p>The mid-infrared spectral region is quite ideal for sensitive spectroscopy e.g. of many gases, such as air pollutants.
Unfortunately, <a href="mid_infrared_laser_sources.html" title="light sources emitting mid-infrared radiation in the form of a laser-like beam">mid-infrared laser sources</a> are typically less powerful and/or more complicated and expensive than near-infrared laser sources.
For example, one may apply <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">difference frequency generation</a> in <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a>, requiring two input wavelengths and often leading to quite low <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a>.
Other challenges are that it is more difficult to obtain optical materials with high transmission at long wavelengths and also sensitive <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a>.
Therefore, one often exploits overtones, i.e., absorption lines at higher optical frequencies, corresponding to shorter wavelengths, where suitable laser sources are more easily realized and better photodetectors are available (in the extreme case, even for <a href="photon_counting.html" title="photodetection at low light levels where single photon absorption events are counted">photon counting</a>).
However, such overtone absorption bands are weaker and thus often result in a lower sensitivity.</p>
<p>Absorption measurements are often done with <a href="spectrophotometers.html" title="instruments for measuring the wavelength-dependent transmittance or reflectance of solutions or solid objects">spectrophotometers</a>.
Such instruments can cover large wavelength ranges and provide a reasonably high wavelength resolution.
However, they can utilize only a quite limited propagation length in a medium and are therefore not suitable for substances with very low <a href="absorbance.html" title="the logarithm with base 10 of the inverse transmittance">absorbance</a>.</p>
<p>A low absorption coefficient can still allow for a high sensitivity if the pass length of light is increased accordingly.
Therefore, one uses <a href="multipass_gas_cells.html" title="a cell which allows to realize multiple passes of a laser beam through a gas">multipass gas cells</a>, where a long path length can be realized in a still relatively compact cell.
This principle, however, allows a large number of passes only if the light is a relatively high spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>.
Therefore, multipass absorption cells are most effective in combination with lasers.</p>
<p><a href="laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="methods of absorption spectroscopy using laser light">Laser absorption spectroscopy</a> also has the advantage of substantially higher wavelength resolution, since the <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> of a laser can be far smaller than the resolution of the spectrometer.
A welcome side effect of improved resolution is that the sensitivity for narrow-band absorption features is also much improved.</p>
<p>There are also resonant techniques, where one uses absorption inside a passive <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonator</a> (e.g., <em>cavity ring-down spectroscopy</em>) or within the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> (<a href="intracavity_laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="a method of laser spectroscopy, based on the evolution of the optical spectrum of intracavity radiation under the influence of narrowband absorption features"><em>intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy</em></a>).
In the latter case, one may e.g. use a broadband <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a>, where the output spectrum is detected for some time after applying a short pump pulse.
Even weak absorption features can lead to pronounced dips in the measured spectrum as that absorption applies in many subsequent resonator round-trips.</p>
<p>Spectroscopy is not only applied to microscopic particles, but also to macroscopic objects such as <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonators</a>.
For example, a high-<a href="finesse.html" title="the free spectral range divided by the FWHM width of the resonances of an optical resonator">finesse</a> stable optical resonator can be used as an <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules">optical frequency standard</a> and probed with spectroscopic methods.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Other Effects of Absorption</h3>
<div>
<p>Usually, the measured effect in spectroscopy is the reduction in <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> due to the absorption.
However, there are also other possibilities.
For example, in <em>photoacoustic spectroscopy</em> one exploits the generation of sound by absorption of light from a power-modulated source.
The absorbed light leads to some heating, which causes expansion of the gas and thus generates a sound wave, which can be detected with a sensitive microphone.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Emission or Scattering of Light</h3>
<div>
<p>Matter can also be exited to emit or scatter light with characteristic features.
This is already possible with simple heating or by illumination with sun light.
For example, a spectrometer on a satellite may record spectra of scattered light from the earth surface in order to distinguish rocks, plants, lake surfaces, etc.</p>
<p>In astronomy, one analyzes the optical spectra of light from distant stars and galaxies, which carries information on temperatures, chemical compositions, speed of movement etc.
In laboratories, one often uses a gas discharge for exciting atoms or molecules such that they radiate light.</p>
<p>Many advanced spectroscopic methods use the illumination of a sample with a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> source.
The absorbed light may not only lead to heating, but also excite atoms or molecules, which then subsequently emit <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> light.
One may record the spectrum of the emitted light and/or the strength of excitation as a function of the wavelength of the <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">pump light</a>; both methods can lead to highly specific detection of certain substances or allow one to measure certain microscopic properties of materials.
For more details, see the article on <a href="fluorescence_spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy which is based on the analysis of fluorescence light">fluorescence spectroscopy</a>.</p>
<p>Another option is <a href="laser_induced_breakdown.html" title="a kind of spark, initiated by intense laser light"><em>laser-induced breakdown</em></a> <em>spectroscopy</em>, where one excites a sample with intense laser <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a>, forming a plasma, and detects light then emitted by the sample in the visible and/or infrared spectral region.</p>
<p>An example for such methods is the investigation of laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain media</a>.
A <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> with suitable optical frequency can excite laser-active ions into <a href="metastable_states.html" title="excited states (particularly electronic states in laser gain media) which have a relatively long lifetime due to slow radiative and non-radiative decay">metastable states</a>, from which they may be further excited (for sufficiently high optical intensities) or get back to the ground state, emitting fluorescence light.
The fluorescence spectrum is related to the wavelength-dependent emission <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a>, which are relevant for the achievable laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>.
One may also detect the decay of fluorescence intensity after excitation with a short laser <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a> in order to determine the <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>.
With a combination of spectroscopic techniques, one may achieve a comprehensive characterization of the physical details of laser gain media such as <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> or <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a> [8].
One may even study subtle effects such as interactions between different laser-active ions, leading to <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfer</a> phenomena.</p>
<p>Another example is <a href="raman_spectroscopy.html" title="optical spectroscopy based on spontaneous or stimulated Raman scattering"><em>Raman spectroscopy</em></a>, where a substance is irradiated with narrow-band light at a high optical power level (usually obtained from a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>), and one detects the weak emission of light with slightly longer wavelengths, which arises from spontaneous and/or stimulated <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a>, a kind of inelastic scattering.
The spectrum of Raman-scattered light (which is separated from the pump light with a special narrow-band dichroic <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filter</a> such as <a href="rugate_filters.html" title="dielectric interference filters with a continuous variation of the refractive index">Rugate filters</a>) contains information on molecular vibrations.
For more details, see the article on <a href="raman_spectroscopy.html" title="optical spectroscopy based on spontaneous or stimulated Raman scattering">Raman spectroscopy</a>.</p>
<p>High-energy <a href="lidar.html" title="a technique for acquiring 3D images with laser pulses">LIDAR</a> systems, as used e.g. in atmospheric research, allow remote spectroscopic measurements over large distances.
Here, one may e.g. exploit Doppler shifts of back-scattered light, which reveal longitudinal wind velocities.
A variety of methods has been developed which allow the remote measurement of many properties such as temperature, pressure, trace gas concentrations and cloud particle densities.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Changes of Optical Phase</h3>
<div>
<p>In some spectroscopic methods, one exploits changes of the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phase</a>.
Typically, an interaction of interest occurs in one arm of an <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometer</a>.
The resulting phase changes can be sensitively detected because they are turned into power changes at the interferometer output.
Phase changes resulting from absorption lines are also relevant in <em>frequency modulation spectroscopy</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Methods of Spectroscopy</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Spectral Decomposition of Transmitted Light</h3>
<div>
<p>One may use a broadband light source (<a href="white_light_sources.html" title="light sources with very broad optical bandwidth"><em>white light source</em></a>) and then apply a spectral decomposition in the photodetection system.
Often, a high spectral sensitivity is obtained by combining the <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> with some kind of <a href="monochromators.html" title="optical devices which transmit only light in an adjustable small range of optical wavelengths">monochromator</a>.
A high-resolution <a href="spectrometers.html" title="devices for separating spectral components">spectrometer</a>, for example, allows measurements for many different narrow wavelength bins without precisely controlling a light source.
The measurement time may be long if each wavelength is treated separated and there are many narrow wavelength bins, but some spectrometers can simultaneously record many wavelengths, e.g. when they contain a CCD array instead of a single <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a>.</p>
<p>A special way of obtaining spectral resolution is the use of an <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometer</a> where an arm length is scanned during the measurement.
With a narrow-band light source, that would result in a simple sinusoidal oscillation of the output power.
With a broadband source, however, one obtains a superposition of many different oscillations.
Using a Fourier transform, one can retrieve the spectrum.
(Interferometric <a href="wavemeters.html" title="devices for precise measurements of laser wavelengths">wavemeters</a> have a similar working principle.)
Such methods are called <a href="fourier_transform_spectroscopy.html" title="a method for spectroscopy rare an optical spectrum is computed from raw data with a Fourier transform"><em>Fourier transform spectroscopy</em></a>.
This is often applied in the infrared spectral region and then also called <em>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy</em> (= <em>FTIR spectroscopy</em>).
Many modern infrared spectrometers are based on such techniques.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Variation of the Source Wavelength</h3>
<div>
<p>In many cases, spectroscopy is done with a wavelength-tunable light source.
(Various such sources are discussed below.)
One may then, for example, measure the absorption of a sample as a function of the emission wavelength of the laser.
As it is more difficult to make a widely tunable narrow-band laser source, that technique often leads to a smaller tuning range &ndash; smaller than the range possible with a simple broadband light source.
However, the method offers superior resolution and also rapid data acquisition with low noise, as one can obtain a relatively strong detector signal.
Note that all available optical power is concentrated on a particular wavelength of interest, rather than spread over the whole measurement range.</p>
<p>As the optical power often somewhat varies with wavelength (and possibly also with time), a high precision requires monitoring of that power.
This can be done, for example, in two-beam spectrometers, where the light from the source is split into two beams.
Only one beam (the sample beam), but not the reference beam, is sent through the medium under investigation, and the powers or intensities of both beams are measured.
Particularly high sensitivities can be obtained with balanced photodetectors, where one directly measures the difference of <a href="photocurrent.html" title="an electric current which is induced by incident light in a photodetector">photocurrents</a> from the two beams.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Exploitation of Nonlinear Effects</h3>
<div>
<p>When high-intensity light sources (normally lasers) are used, one may exploit various <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear optical effects</a> for spectroscopy.
The saturation of absorption is exploited in Doppler-free <a href="laser_spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of laser light with matter is utilized">laser spectroscopy</a>.
<a href="raman_spectroscopy.html" title="optical spectroscopy based on spontaneous or stimulated Raman scattering">Raman spectroscopy</a> has already been mentioned above.
<a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">Two-photon absorption</a> has been utilized for a long time [6].
Another important example is <em>coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy</em> (CARS), where two input waves generate a detected signal with slightly higher optical frequency via <a href="four_wave_mixing.html" title="an interaction of light waves based on a &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity">four-wave mixing</a>.
Various other nonlinear effects, such as <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a>, can be exploited with other methods.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Elimination of Doppler Effects</h3>
<div>
<p>Atoms and molecules in gases can exhibit substantial <a href="doppler_broadening.html" title="broadening of the linewidth of atomic transitions, caused by random motion of the emitting atoms">Doppler broadening</a> of their absorption lines due to their thermal motion.
There are, however, various methods of <em>Doppler-free spectroscopy</em>.
For example, this can involve counterpropagating laser beams, where a probe beam in one direction selects a certain velocity class via absorption saturation [1], and the other beam detects that saturation.
This methods is called <em>Doppler-free saturation spectroscopy</em> [26].</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Terahertz Spectroscopy</h3>
<div>
<p>A relatively new field is terahertz spectroscopy [21], where <a href="terahertz_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation with frequencies around 0.1 THz to 10 THz">terahertz radiation</a> (with frequencies e.g. of hundreds of gigahertz to several terahertz) is used instead of light.
Although <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> cannot directly emit terahertz radiation, they can be used in different waves for <a href="terahertz_sources.html" title="sources of electromagnetic radiation with frequencies around 0.1 THz to 10 THz">generating</a> such radiation, e.g. by using techniques of <a href="electro_optic_sampling.html" title="an optical sampling technique based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic sampling</a> or <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>.
Also, <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a> lasers are useful for the <a href="time_resolved_spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy where time-dependent signals are measured">time-resolved</a> <a href="terahertz_detectors.html" title="detectors for terahertz radiation">detection</a> of terahertz waves.
As many optically opaque materials have a substantial transparency for terahertz radiation, terahertz spectroscopy can be used for a wide range of investigations in science and technology.
For example, it is now used for fault location in airplane parts and in security screenings.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Frequency Combs</h3>
<div>
<p>Some techniques of modern laser spectroscopy employ <a href="frequency_combs.html" title="optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines">frequency combs</a> as generated with <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a> [15].
As such a frequency comb contains some number of exactly equidistant lines in the spectrum, all of its frequency components are known (apart from some noise) if only two parameters are fixed (possibly stabilized with some feedback techniques): the comb spacing, which is related to the <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a>, and the <a href="carrier_envelope_offset.html" title="the offset between the optical phase and the maximum of the wave envelope of an optical pulse">carrier&ndash;envelope offset</a> frequency.
Therefore, frequency combs can serve for extremely precise frequency measurements in wide wavelength ranges, if they are produced with a high optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> (sometimes more than octave-spanning) and with proper frequency stabilization.
There are various important applications in <a href="frequency_metrology.html" title="the field of technology dealing with precise frequency measurements">frequency metrology</a> (in particular, ultraprecise <a href="optical_clocks.html" title="time measurement devices based on optical frequency standards">optical clocks</a>) and other fields.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Time-resolved Spectroscopy with High Temporal Resolution</h3>
<div>
<p>Spectroscopy may also involve <a href="time_resolved_spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy where time-dependent signals are measured">time-resolved</a> measurements with an extremely high temporal resolution.
In <a href="pump_probe_measurements.html" title="techniques for investigating ultrafast phenomena, where a pump pulse excites a sample and a probe pulse is used for probing the sample after an adjustable delay time"><em>pump&ndash;probe spectroscopy</em></a> one uses an <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort</a> pump pulse, followed by a probe pulse with a variable time delay between a few femtoseconds and several nanoseconds.
The effect of the pump pulse on the sample and thus on the probe pulse can be measured as a function of the time delay, which is often adjusted simply via a variable <a href="optical_delay_lines.html" title="an optical setup which is used to introduce a time delay for a light beam">optical delay line</a>
An alternative is to use to two mode-locked lasers with slightly different <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a>, so that a range of time delays is scanned continuously.</p>

<h2>Your Lab is Closed due to the Corona Virus Crisis?</h2>
<p>Time to think how to best utilize your time!</p>
<p>Here is a suggestion: <br> <b>Consider to start with physical modeling!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Build models for your existing or planned lasers and amplifiers, resonators, etc.</li>
<li>Utilize such models in order to <b>improve your qualitative and quantitative understanding</b>, solve problems, optimize device performance and <b>develop new ideas</b>.</li>
<li>Power up your home office instead of wasting your time!</li>
<li>When getting back to the lab, restart with fresh plans and full power.</li>
