See the article on <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> for information on more general aspects.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Setup and Operation Principle</h2>
<div>
<p>A typical setup of a simple erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) is shown in Figure&nbsp;1.
Its core is the erbium-doped optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>, which is typically a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>.
In the shown case, the <a href="active_fibers.html" title="optical fibers containing laser-active dopants in the fiber core"><em>active fiber</em></a> is &ldquo;pumped&rdquo; with light from two <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> (bidirectional pumping), although unidirectional pumping in the forward or backward direction (co-directional and counter-directional pumping) is also very common.
The pump light, which most often has a wavelength around 980&nbsp;nm and sometimes around 1450&nbsp;nm, excites the erbium ions (Er<sup>3+</sup>) into the <sup>4</sup>I<sub>13/2</sub> state (in the case of 980-nm pumping via <sup>4</sup>I<sub>11/2</sub>), from where they can amplify light in the 1.5-&mu;m wavelength region via <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a> back to the ground-state manifold <sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub>.
(See also Figure&nbsp;1 in the article on <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium-doped gain media</a>.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_amplifier.png" alt="erbium-doped fiber amplifier">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Schematic setup of a simple erbium-doped fiber amplifier.
Two laser diodes (LDs) provide the pump power for the erbium-doped fiber.
The pump light is injected via dichroic <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a>.
Pig-tailed optical <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">isolators</a> reduce the sensitivity of the device to back-reflections.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The setup shown also contains two &ldquo;pig-tailed&rdquo; (fiber-coupled) optical isolators.
The isolator at the input prevents light originating from <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> from disturbing any previous stages, whereas that at the output suppresses lasing (or possibly even destruction) if output light is reflected back to the amplifier.
Without isolators, fiber amplifiers can be sensitive to back-reflections.</p>
<p>Apart from optical isolators, various other components can be contained in a commercial fiber amplifier.
For example, there can be <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a> and <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> for monitoring <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> levels, pump <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> with control electronics and <a href="gain_equalization.html" title="a technique for making the gain spectrum of an optical amplifier device flatter over a certain optical frequency range">gain-flattening filters</a>.
For particularly compact packages, various passive optical components can be combined into a <a href="photonic_integrated_circuits.html" title="integrated circuits with optical functions">photonic integrated circuit</a> (<em>planar lightwave circuit</em>).</p>
<p>Very high signal gains, as used, e.g., for the amplification of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> to high energies, are usually realized with <a href="amplifier_chains.html" title="amplifiers consisting of several stages">amplifier chains</a>, consisting of several amplifier stages with additional optical elements (e.g. isolators, <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">filters</a>, or modulators) in between.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Gain Spectrum</h2>
<div>
<p>The shape of the erbium gain spectrum depends on the <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> and emission <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a>, which depend on the host glass.
Also, the spectral shape of the gain and not only its magnitude is substantially influenced by the average degree of excitation of the erbium ions, because these have a <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level transition</a>.
Figure&nbsp;2 shows data for a common type of glass, which is some variant of silica with additional dopants e.g. to avoid clustering of erbium ions.
Other glass compositions can lead to substantially different gain spectra.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/erbium_gain.png" alt="erbium gain">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Gain and absorption (negative gain) of erbium (Er<sup>3+</sup>) ions in a <a href="phosphate_glasses.html" title="certain glasses from which certain optical fibers and laser gain media can be made, for example">phosphate glass</a> for excitation levels from 0 to 100&#37; in steps of 20&#37;.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Strong three-level behavior (with transparency reached only for &gt;&thinsp;50&#37; excitation) occurs at 1535&nbsp;nm.
In that spectral region, the unpumped fiber exhibits substantial losses, but the high emission cross section allows for a high gain for strong excitation.
At longer wavelengths (e.g. 1580&nbsp;nm), a lower excitation level is required for obtaining gain, but the maximum gain is smaller.</p>
<p>The maximum gain typically occurs in the wavelength region around 1530&ndash;1560&nbsp;nm, with the 1530-nm peak being most pronounced for high excitation levels, whereas low excitation levels lead to gain maxima at longer wavelengths.
The local excitation level depends on the emission and absorption <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a> and on the pump and signal intensity (apart from that of ASE light).
The average excitation level over the whole fiber length, as is relevant for the net gain spectrum, depends on the pump and signal powers, but also on the fiber length and the erbium <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">concentration</a>.
Such parameters (together with the choice of glass composition) are used to optimize an EDFA for a particular wavelength region, such as the telecom C or L band.</p>
<p>A good flatness of the gain in a wide wavelength region (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="gain_equalization.html" title="a technique for making the gain spectrum of an optical amplifier device flatter over a certain optical frequency range"><em>gain equalization</em></a>), as required e.g. for <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain">wavelength division multiplexing</a> (see below), can be obtained by using optimized glass hosts (e.g. telluride or <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride fibers</a>, or some combination of amplifier sections with different glasses) or by combination with appropriate <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filters</a>, such as long-period <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Erbium-doped Amplifiers in Telecom Systems</h2>
<div>
<p>EDFAs can serve various functions in systems for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>; the most important applications are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The power of a data transmitter may be boosted with a high-power EDFA before entering a long fiber span, or a device with large losses, such as a <a href="beam_splitters.html" title="devices for splitting a laser beam into two or more beams">fiber-optic splitter</a>.
Such splitters are widely used e.g. in cable-TV systems, where a single transmitter is used to deliver signals into many fibers.</li>
<li>A fiber amplifier may also be used in front of a data receiver, if the arriving signal is weak.
Despite the introduction of <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">amplifier noise</a>, this can improve the <a href="signal_to_noise_ratio.html" title="the ratio of signal power to noise power in a detector">signal-to-noise ratio</a> and thus the possible data transmission rate, since the amplifier noise may be weaker than the input noise of the receiver.
It is more common, however, to use <a href="avalanche_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with internal signal amplification through an avalanche process">avalanche photodiodes</a>, which have some built-in signal amplification.</li>
<li>In-line EDFAs are used between long spans of passive transmission fiber.
Using multiple amplifiers in a long <a href="fiber_optic_links.html" title="optical communication links where the signal light is transported in fibers">fiber-optic link</a> has the advantage that large transmission losses can be compensated without (a) letting the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> drop to too low levels, which would spoil the signal-to-noise ratio, and (b) without transmitting excessive optical powers at other locations, which would cause detrimental nonlinear effects due to the unavoidable fiber <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>.
Many of these in-line EDFAs are operated even under difficult conditions, e.g. on the ocean floor, where maintenance would be hardly possible.</li>
<li>Although data transmitters are normally not based on erbium-doped devices, an EDFA can be part of equipment for testing transmission hardware.
It can also be used in the context of optical signal processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>These functions can be realized in the telecom C and L bands.
Other types of fiber amplifiers, e.g. based on praseodymium, have been considered for other bands, but none can compete with erbium-based devices in terms of gain and gain efficiency.</p>
<p>A particular attraction of EDFAs is their large <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a>, which is typically tens of nanometers and thus actually more than enough to amplify data channels with the highest data rates without introducing any effects of gain narrowing.
A single EDFA may be used for simultaneously amplifying many data channels at different wavelengths within the gain region; this technique is called <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain"><em>wavelength division multiplexing</em></a>.
Before such fiber amplifiers were available, there was no practical method for amplifying all channels e.g. between long fiber spans of a fiber-optic link: one had to separate all data channels, detect and amplify them electronically, optically resubmit and again combine them.
The introduction of fiber amplifiers thus brought an enormous reduction in the complexity, along with a corresponding increase in reliability.
Very long lifetimes are possible by using redundant down-rated pump diodes.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Some EDFAs are specially designed for space division multiplexing.</aside>
<p>Most erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are based on <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>.
However, other types of fiber amplifiers have recently been developed, which can be used in the context of <a href="space_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique for optical data transmission where multiple spatial channels are utilized">space division multiplexing</a>.
Here, the fiber is either a <a href="multi_core_fibers.html" title="optical fibers containing more than one fiber core">multi-core fiber</a> or a <a href="few_mode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting only few guided modes">few-mode fiber</a>.
Such amplifiers need to be optimized such that the gain in the different cores, or in the second case for the different fiber <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>, is quite similar.</p>
<p>The only competitors to erbium-doped fiber amplifiers in the 1.5-&mu;m region are <a href="raman_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on Raman gain">Raman amplifiers</a>, which profit from the development of higher power pump lasers.
Raman amplification can also be done in the transmission fiber.
Nevertheless, EDFAs remain very dominant.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Various Technical Details</h2>
<div>
<p>The most common pump wavelength for EDFAs is around 980&nbsp;nm.
Light at this wavelength pumps erbium ions from their ground-state manifold <sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub> to the <sup>4</sup>I<sub>11/2</sub> manifold, from where there is a quick <a href="non_radiative_transitions.html" title="transitions between energy levels of atoms or ions which are not associated with the emission of light">non-radiative</a> transfer to the upper laser level <sup>4</sup>I<sub>13/2</sub>.
Due to that quick transfer, there is essentially no deexcitation via stimulated emission by pump light, and very high excitation levels can be achieved.
Therefore, this approach makes it possible to achieve the highest <a href="gain_efficiency.html" title="small-signal gain of an optical amplifier per unit pump power or per unit stored energy">gain efficiency</a> (order of 10&nbsp;dB/mW) and the lowest <a href="noise_figure.html" title="a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a>, although the power efficiency is not ideal due to the significant <a href="quantum_defect.html" title="energy difference between pump and laser photons">quantum defect</a>.</p>
<p>A higher power efficiency can be achieved by <em>in-band pumping</em> around 1450&nbsp;nm.
However, stimulated emission by pump light then limits the achievable excitation level, hence also the gain per unit length, and the maximum gain occurs at longer wavelengths.
The <a href="noise_figure.html" title="a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a> will also be higher.</p>
<p>Due to the not very high laser <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a>, the <a href="saturation_power.html" title="a measure of the incident optical power required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation power</a> of an EDFA is fairly high compared with that of a <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifier</a>.
Therefore, single symbols in high bit rate data transmissions have a much too low energy to cause any significant gain saturation.
Only over thousands or millions of symbols, the gain adjusts itself to the average signal power level.</p>
<p>In high-gain amplifiers, <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> (ASE) is often a factor limiting the achievable gain.
Due to the quasi-three-level nature of the erbium ions, ASE powers can be different between forward and backward direction, and the maximum ASE can occur at a wavelength which differs from that of maximum gain.</p>
<p>The <a href="noise_figure.html" title="a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a> of an EDFA is slightly larger than the theoretical limit of 3&nbsp;dB for a high-gain amplifier; this is mainly due to the quasi-three-level nature.
Relatively low-noise performance can be achieved with suitable amplifier design, taking into account particularly the erbium excitation level near the signal input end, which can be strongly influenced by, e.g., the pump direction.</p>
<p>Various aspects of erbium-doped amplifiers can be analyzed with suitable <a href="fiber_simulation_software.html" title="software for numerical simulations on fiber devices">fiber simulation software</a>.
The resulting quantitative understanding can be the basis for optimization of devices in terms of performance and required components.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Variants and Other Applications of Erbium-doped Fiber Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p>A high gain in a shorter length can be achieved with <em>ytterbium-sensitized fibers</em> (also called <em>Er:Yb:glass fibers</em> or <em>ytterbium-codoped fibers</em>).
In addition to the erbium dopant, these contain some significant concentration of Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions (typically much more ytterbium than erbium).
Ytterbium ions may then be excited e.g. with 980-nm pump light (or even at longer wavelengths such as 1064&nbsp;nm) and transfer their energy to erbium ions.
For a proper choice of the material composition of the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, this <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfer</a> can be fairly efficient.
However, the use of pure erbium-doped fibers is more common in the telecom area, because ytterbium sensitization has no essential advantages here and possibly leads to a reduced <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> due to the modified chemical composition.</p>
<p>Erbium-doped <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a> can be used for generating very high output powers of tens of watts or even more.
As the <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> efficiency can be weak in this case, an ytterbium-sensitized core may again be useful.</p>
<p>It is also possible to amplify <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> in the 1.5-&mu;m region to relatively high energies, using EDFAs in the form of <a href="amplifier_chains.html" title="amplifiers consisting of several stages">amplifier chains</a>.
One exploits the relatively high <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation energy</a> of such amplifiers, particularly when using erbium-doped <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a>.</p>

<p>If I have a laser with very narrow linewidth, how will the EDFA affect the amplified laser linewidth?</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>Normally, it will not at all increase the linewidth, despite some addition of <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">amplifier noise</a>.
This is essentially because although the amplifier may introduce some time-dependent phase changes, these are limited in extent &ndash; no unbounded phase drifts are possible.</p>

<p>What is the limitation on minimum optical input power to an EDFA?
Is it possible to achieve very high gain (with multiple common amplifiers) with a very low level optical input (e.g. &minus;60&nbsp;dBm) at the cost of an increased noise figure?</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>The practical limit is usually set by <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">ASE</a> within the required amplification <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
If you need to gain over the full bandwidth of an EDFA, the ASE output already becomes fairly strong around 40&nbsp;dB, so that it causes a major power loss (in addition to contaminating the signal).
Within a narrow bandwidth, you could have more gain, and limit the ASE output power by using narrowband bandpass filters between the amplifier stages.
However, it depends on the end on how much ASE contamination of the signal you can tolerate in your application.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="noise_figure.html" title="a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a> of the amplifier chain may still be quite low, if the preamplifier stage is well designed; that does not imply low ASE, however, in such a situation with high gain.</p>
