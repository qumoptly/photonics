<p>There is a wide range of cameras, which are nearly all optical instruments for recording still or moving images, i.e., used for some kind of <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> purpose (with few exceptions like <a href="streak_cameras.html" title="devices for measuring the power of an optical pulse versus time">streak cameras</a>).
This article gives a brief overview on different kinds of optical cameras.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Basic Principles</h2>
<div>
<p>Most cameras involve some kind of optical <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> from the objective scene to some <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> detector, e.g. a photographic film or an electronic <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensor</a>, e.g. of CCD or CMOS type.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">In most cases, some kind of imaging objective is used.</aside>
<p>The simplest imaging method is the principle of the <em>camera obscura</em>, requiring no optical elements except for a <a href="pinholes.html" title="circular holes, typically with diameters well below one millimeter">pinhole</a>.
In practice, however, one nearly always uses some kind of <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objective</a>, for example a <a href="photographic_objectives.html" title="objective lenses used for photography">photographic objective</a> or a <a href="microscope_objectives.html" title="the optical component of a microscope which is next to the observed object">microscope objective</a>.
Its essential purpose is to send light received from distinct points of the object to corresponding points on the detector.
Basic principles of optical imaging are explained in the article on <a href="imaging_with_a_lens.html" title="creation of an optical image using a single lens">imaging with a lens</a>.</p>
<p>As the imaging function can never be perfect, the resulting images have various kinds of imperfections, for example a limited resolution, geometric distortions, deviating colors and a lack of sharpness.
For recording still images, there may also be effects of the finite recording time, e.g. blurring of images related to movements of the object or the camera.</p>
<p>Generally, an imaging system has a limited <a href="depth_of_field.html" title="the distance between the nearest and furthest objects that can be imaged with reasonably sharp focus for a given focus setting"><em>depth of field</em></a>, i.e., a limited range of distances for which sharp imaging is possible.
Tentatively, the depth of field gets smaller for objectives with long <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a> and when using large <a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">optical apertures</a>.
The smaller the depth of field, the more critical is the focus adjustment to a certain object distance.
Many cameras have an <em>autofocus function</em> which does that adjustment automatically.</p>
<p>The article on <a href="imaging_with_a_lens.html" title="creation of an optical image using a single lens">imaging with a lens</a> explains the issues of focusing and the limited depth of field in more detail.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">There are typical trade-offs between camera parameters, which need to be taken into account in decisions.s</aside>
<p>There are generally certain trade-offs which need to be taken into account for decisions on various parameters of a camera.
For example, imaging systems with a large aperture can collect more light, but have a lower depth of field.
An objective with large focal length can collect more light, but also with a reduced depth of field.
For example, miniature smartphone cameras generally exhibit a high depth of field, but a limited light gathering power, so that they have more problems with poor ambient light conditions than ordinary photo cameras, for example.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Photo Cameras</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:400px;">
<img src="img/nikon_d40.jpg" alt="Nikon D40 SLR camera">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A single lens reflex photo camera.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Photo cameras are widely used, mostly for capturing still images, although some of them also allow one to record video sequences.
In terms of image quality and resolution, photo cameras are often superior to video cameras, for example.</p>
<p>Simple consumer-grade &ldquo;point-and-shoot&rdquo; cameras offer a reasonable image quality and various automatic adjustments for easy use; they can be used with a minimum depth of understanding of optics and photography.
For higher aspirations, there are single lens reflex cameras (and cameras based on some modified concepts) which are often offering a higher optical quality and substantially more control by the photographer.
For fully exploiting their potential, one should acquire a decent understanding of various issues, e.g. concerning the use of different objectives and typical trade-offs in operation parameters, ideally also at least some basic understanding of optics.</p>
<p>See the article on <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photo cameras</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Video Cameras</h2>
<div>
<p>Video cameras are cameras for recording moving images, for example for television and surveillance.</p>
<p>With the usual frame rates &ndash; for example, 24 or 50 images per second &ndash;, the amount of collected data per minute is far larger than that of a photograph.
Nevertheless, even consumer-grade camcorders can nowadays store videos of substantial length e.g. on a compact SD storage card.
The following aspects are relevant for this achievement:</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:400px;">
<img src="img/panasonic_camcorder.jpg" alt="camcorder">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
A consumer-grade camcorder.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>The image resolution is often limited to a value well below that used in photography.
For example, for online videos one often requires less than one megapixel, while photography mostly uses at least several megapixels.
Even for large media displays, the resolution is tentatively less critical than for photographs due to the motion.</li>
<li>Advanced electronic chips and compression algorithms allow the application of effective image compression even in compact and cheap cameras.
Beyond the compression of single frames, one can exploit the fact that images often change significantly only in limited areas.
The compression usually causes some loss of image quality, which often can be easily tolerated as the price for a substantial reduction of the amount of data.</li>
<li>The storage capacity of compact and cheap electronic devices, typically based on flash memory, has enormously increased.</li>
</ul>
<p>Camcorders (see Figure&nbsp;2) are lightweight portable cameras, which have become widespread and offer advanced features even at quite moderate price levels.
Although even smartphones nowadays allow one to record videos, camcorders (and of course larger video cameras with exchangeable objectives) present substantially higher image quality.</p>
<p>Video cameras for surveillance purposes often provide a continuous stream of media data into a computer network.
One may use continuous recording, but always erasing or strongly reducing the data after limited time.
If some critical incident is detected, image data can be saved to remain available for closer inspection.
Advanced computer algorithms with image recognition can provide automatic warnings when certain situations are detected.
Also, strong image compression is possible if the observed scene exhibits little change.</p>
<p>Very compact video cameras with relatively simple design are used e.g. in notebooks or as separate USB webcams.
They normally have a rather small focal length, no optical zoom and moderate image resolution.
Due to the small focal length, they exhibit a large <a href="depth_of_field.html" title="the distance between the nearest and furthest objects that can be imaged with reasonably sharp focus for a given focus setting">depth of field</a> and also a viewing perspective which is not particularly appealing.
One would hardly use such a camera for making a portrait photograph, but for applications like video chats they are usually considered to be sufficient.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Microscope Cameras</h2>
<div>
<p>Some optical <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscopes</a> are equipped with a camera for recording microscopic images.
This can be a film camera or a camera based on some digital electronic image sensor, then often also providing a video stream.</p>
<p>Digital cameras usually have a connection to a computer, e.g. with an USB cable.
One can then not only use the computer for storing many images, but also utilize a large computer screen for convenient viewing &ndash; also for more than one person at a time.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Infrared Cameras</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Near infrared light can be detected quite easily.</aside>
<p>There are <a href="infrared_cameras.html" title="cameras which work with infrared light">infrared cameras</a>, which are sensitive to <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a> &ndash; often not to visible light.
Some of them work in the near infrared, using image sensors which are fairly similar to those for ordinary visible light cameras.
For example, the usual silicon-based image sensors exhibit a significant <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> for optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> up to approximately 1&nbsp;&mu;m.
Such cameras can be used for surveillance purposes, for example, in combination with infrared illumination, which is not recognized by intruders.
Similar devices are used as laser <a href="beam_profilers.html" title="devices for measuring the intensity profile of a laser beam">beam profilers</a>.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Longer infrared wavelengths require more advanced detectors.</aside>
<p>Infrared cameras for substantially longer wavelengths can provide <a href="night_vision_devices.html" title="instruments which allow viewing or imaging under conditions of very low light levels">night vision</a> without active illumination, exploiting only the <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">thermal radiation</a> of objects.
For temperatures around room temperature, however, <a href="thermal_imaging.html" title="imaging based on thermal radiation">thermal imaging</a> requires a substantial <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> for relatively long wavelengths of several micrometers, which is possible only with special infrared image sensors (e.g. microbolometers).
Those are comparatively expensive and exhibit performance figures which are clearly inferior to those of devices for shorter wavelengths.
Also, such cameras require special <a href="infrared_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems which are suitable for infrared light">infrared optics</a>, which are relatively expensive and partly also less robust.
High performance long-wave infrared cameras contain semiconductor sensors which need to be cooled.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Streak Cameras</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="streak_cameras.html" title="devices for measuring the power of an optical pulse versus time">Streak cameras</a> are an exception in the sense that they are not imaging devices.
Instead, they are used like ultrafast oscilloscopes for studying very fast time-dependent signals.</p>

<h2>Short-term Software Licenses Available</h2>
<p>Do you need simulation software (such as our <a href="./fiberpower.html?banner=rented_software">RP Fiber Power</a>) only during a <b>short-term project</b>?</p>
<p>Or do you want to <b>test such software very thoroughly</b> before fully committing to it?</p>
<p>RP Photonics is now offering a solution: <a href="./software_licenses.html?banner=rented_software">software licenses</a> which are valid for a <b>limited time</b>.</p>
<p>Our conditions are very fair:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay only 5% of the amount for a permanent license for one month.</li>
<li>When switching over to a permanent license directly thereafter, get the already paid money fully deducted!</li>
<li>If you decide for that only later on, still get two thirds deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are confident that you will like our software and finally decide for permanent licenses.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2009_10_19.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
