<p>A white light source is usually understood to be a light source generating <a href="white_light.html" title="light which creates a white color impression">white light</a>, i.e., with a white perception for the human eye.</p>
<p>Some typical types of white light sources are explained in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">Incandescent lamps</a> (e.g., a tungsten-<a href="halogen_lamps.html" title="incandescent lamps with a halogen filling, allowing for higher operation temperatures">halogen lamps</a>) naturally emit light with a smooth and very broad <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>.
They are cheap to fabricate and easy to handle, but have a quite limited <a href="luminous_efficacy_and_efficiency.html" title="the luminous flux of a light source divided by its the radiant power or its electrical consumption (efficacy); the ratio of reached efficacy to the theoretically possible efficacy (luminous efficiency)">luminous efficacy</a>.
The lifetime is also often less than satisfactory.</li>
<li>Some types of <a href="gas_discharge_lamps.html" title="light sources which are based on an electrical discharge in an ionized gas or metal vapor">gas discharge lamps</a>, in particular high-pressure <a href="arc_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps based on an electrical arc, or continuously operating gas discharge lamps">arc lamps</a> and <a href="flash_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps which are used for generating intense light pulses">flash lamps</a>, for example <a href="xenon_lamps.html" title="lamps based on an electrical discharge in xenon gas">xenon lamps</a>, can produce bright white light.
<a href="metal_halide_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps containing metal halides">Metal halide lamps</a> offer particularly high performance in terms of <a href="radiance.html" title="the optical power per unit area and solid angle">radiance</a> and <a href="luminous_efficacy_and_efficiency.html" title="the luminous flux of a light source divided by its the radiant power or its electrical consumption (efficacy); the ratio of reached efficacy to the theoretically possible efficacy (luminous efficiency)">luminous efficacy</a>.
Device lifetimes vary strongly, depending on the type of lamps and its operation conditions.</li>
<li>Spectra of <a href="fluorescent_lamps.html" title="lamps which emit fluorescent light, usually generated by irradiation of a phosphor with light from an electric gas discharge">fluorescent lamps</a> or some other gas discharge lamps can also look white but are sometimes much more structured.
Such white light sources often have a low <a href="color_rendering_index.html" title="a quantity which can be used for estimating how accurately colors can be perceived when using a specific light source">color rendering index</a>.</li>
<li><a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">Light-emitting diodes</a> (LEDs) in a strict sense cannot generate white light, but there are LED-based white light emitters (often called white LEDs), which mostly contain a blue (GaN-based) LED and a <a href="phosphors.html" title="substances which exhibit luminescence, used mostly for illumination and displays">phosphor</a> which absorbs part of the blue light and emits <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> at longer wavelengths, so that the overall color impression is white.
It is also possible to combine the radiation e.g. of LEDs emitting red, green and blue light.</li>
<li><a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">Lasers</a> are not suitable for directly generating white light.
However, there are laser-based <a href="rgb_sources.html" title="source of red, green and blue light, which is usually provided in the form laser beams">RGB sources</a>, and by mixing their red, green and blue outputs, one can obtain intense white light.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various <a href="cie_standard_illuminants.html" title="standardized optical spectra for white light sources">CIE standard illuminants</a> serve as standard references for different types of white light spectra.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Essential Properties of White Light Sources</h2>
<div>
<p>The following properties of white light sources are often particularly important for applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>For applications like lighting, the <a href="color_temperature.html" title="the temperature of a blackbody radiator which leads to a color impression of the thermal light which matches most closely the light of a light source">color temperature</a> of a white light source, indicating its color tone, is an important parameter.</li>
<li>The <a href="color_rendering_index.html" title="a quantity which can be used for estimating how accurately colors can be perceived when using a specific light source">color rendering index</a> (CRI) is a measure for how well colors can be judged when objects are illuminated with that light.</li>
<li>Concerning energy efficiency, the <a href="luminous_efficacy_and_efficiency.html" title="the luminous flux of a light source divided by its the radiant power or its electrical consumption (efficacy); the ratio of reached efficacy to the theoretically possible efficacy (luminous efficiency)">luminous efficacy</a> is an important parameter.
Note that the effectively achieved energy efficiency can also substantially depend on how directional the light emission is.
For example, the energy-saving qualities of LED-based solutions often come to a substantial degree from their directed emission, making it easier to send the light where it is needed.</li>
<li>The temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> of any white light source is necessarily low as a consequence of its broad optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.</li>
<li>Many white light sources also have a low spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>, making it difficult to tightly focus the light, and a correspondingly low <a href="radiance.html" title="the optical power per unit area and solid angle">radiance</a>.
For example, that applies to long-arc lamps, having a large light-emitting volume.
A low radiance is usually no problem for applications like lighting, but is not acceptable for applications like projection displays.
Higher radiance can be achieved with short-arc lamps, which are operated with high power densities (<a href="high_intensity_discharge_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps operating with high power density">high intensity discharge lamps</a>).</li>
<li>Most white light sources operate continuously, some others are made for pulsed emission &ndash; in particular, <a href="flash_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps which are used for generating intense light pulses">flash lamps</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our properties of interest may be the operation lifetime, the ability of rapid switching, the constancy of the <a href="radiant_flux.html" title="radiant energy per unit time which is emitted, transmitted, reflected or received by an object">radiant flux</a> (low <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a>, weak aging, weak temperature dependence), the constancy of the spectral shape and color tone, and the absence of possibly disturbing <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Application of White Light Sources</h2>
<div>
<p>Many white light sources are required for various lighting applications (indoor and outdoor), where one often needs to generate a substantial <a href="luminous_flux.html" title="a measure of the perceived power of light, e.g. from a light source">luminous flux</a> over extended times.
The energy efficiency, largely determined by the luminous efficacy, is then particularly important.</p>
<p>There are various other applications in the context of illumination, often in a more or less localized manner &ndash; for example, reading lights, projection displays, machine vision and <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscope</a> illumination.</p>
<p>Pulsed white light sources can be used for <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photography</a>, for stroboscopes and in some scientific applications.</p>
<p>Further, there are special applications of white light sources in scientific and technical areas such as <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a>, <a href="colorimetry.html" title="the science and technology of objectively measuring optical properties related to color impressions for the human eye">colorimetry</a>, forensic investigations and solar cell testing.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Other Broadband Light Sources</h2>
<div>
<p>In some cases, the term <em>white light sources</em> is used for sources which do not really produce a white color impression, but just produce light with a broad optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
Some of them do not even emit in the visible spectral range, while others cover a range from somewhere in the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> to the <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a>.
Certain applications such as <a href="white_light_interferometers.html" title="interferometers using broadband light inputs">white light interferometry</a> do not really need a white color impression, but just the large bandwidth.
Other examples for applications are the characterization of optical components and <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a>.</p>
<p>While most white light sources have a poor spatial coherence, there are broadband sources with a high spatial coherence, sometimes even with the whole optical power delivered in a single spatial mode e.g. of an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>.
This allows focusing of the radiation to very small spots.
Such sources can be different types of <a href="superluminescent_sources.html" title="optical sources based on superluminescence">superluminescent sources</a>, e.g. <a href="superluminescent_diodes.html" title="broadband semiconductor light sources based on superluminescence">superluminescent diodes</a> or ASE sources based on <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>.</p>
<p>For particularly high bandwidths, sometimes even more than octave-spanning, one may employ <a href="supercontinuum_generation.html" title="a nonlinear process for strong spectral broadening of light">supercontinuum</a> sources, based on <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">strongly nonlinear interactions</a> e.g. in an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>.
Most widely used for those are <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>.
The input light can be supplied in the form <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>, nanosecond pulses, or continuously.</p>
<p>For some applications, the optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> specified as a full-width half-maximum value is important, whereas weak tails in the spectrum are not relevant.
In other cases, it is only important to have at least some moderate level of <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> over a broad range, even if the spectral flux varies a lot within that range.</p>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
</ul>
