<p>The method of <em>balanced photodetection</em> (or <em>differential photodetection</em>) has been developed for detecting small differences in <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> between two optical input signals while largely suppressing any common fluctuations of the inputs.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:284px;">
<img src="img/balanced_detection.png" alt="balanced detection">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A simple electronics circuit for balanced photodetection.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In its simplest form, one uses two <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> connected in series, so that their <a href="photocurrent.html" title="an electric current which is induced by incident light in a photodetector">photocurrents</a> cancel each other when they are equal (see Figure&nbsp;1).
The difference in photocurrents is sent to a transimpedance amplifier, which produces an output voltage proportional to that difference.</p>
<p>As an example for an application, we can consider the measurement of weak <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> features in <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a>.
Here, one photodetector is used for light which is transmitted through a spectroscopic sample, while the other photodetector is illuminated with light from the same source but which has not gone through the sample.
(The two light beams are obtained with a <a href="beam_splitters.html" title="devices for splitting a laser beam into two or more beams">beam splitter</a> between the light source and the sample.)
Any <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a> of the used light source is largely canceled out with that balanced detection scheme, so that measurements with an improved <a href="signal_to_noise_ratio.html" title="the ratio of signal power to noise power in a detector">signal-to-noise ratio</a> can be done.</p>
<p>The mentioned cancellation is called <em>common mode rejection</em> and can be quantified in <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a>.
One often achieves 50&nbsp;dB or more.</p>
<p>Although a balanced detection setup can be assembled from single components, it can be helpful to use a prefabricated complete assembly, containing matched photodiodes (see below) and the required electronics.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optimizing Common Mode Rejection</h2>
<div>
<p>Perfect cancellation would require a perfect match between the two detectors including the optical paths.
There are different approaches to optimize a setup in that respect:</p>
<ul>
<li>One may use <em>matched photodiodes</em>, having very similar properties.
They may be made on the same semiconductor chip in the same process.
However, this approach does of course not help against optical asymmetries.</li>
<li>One can use an <em>adjustable</em> <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam"><em>optical attenuator</em></a> for one of the beams, which may also compensate for any difference in <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> between the two detectors.</li>
<li>There are <em>auto-balanced photodetectors</em>, where an electronic circuit automatically cancels asymmetries to some extent.
For example, one may use a electronically controlled current splitter for one of the photodiodes and a feedback circuit with a limited bandwidth for controlling that current splitter.
The actual measurement can then be done only for frequencies above that feedback bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="right" style="width:500px;">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that problems can arise e.g. when a free-space input beam extends to the edges of the light-sensitive region on a detector: small changes of beam position may then translate into significant photocurrent changes which affect the difference signal.
Deviations from perfect uniformity of the detector <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> may cause similar problems in conjunction with changes of beam position.
Such problems cannot occur for fiber-coupled photodiodes with <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>, except when free-space light needs to be coupled into such fibers.
All-fiber setups, particularly when made with <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining</a> <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>, can be optimized for particularly high common mode rejection.</p>
<p>Of course, any asymmetries in the electronics should also be avoided.
Particularly for high-frequency detection, it is also important to have precisely matched cable lengths, since otherwise one would introduce frequency-dependent phase shifts.</p>
<p>Some balanced detectors have an additional low-frequency monitor output which can be used to check the balance of photocurrents.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Shot Noise</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Shot noise is a limiting factor for the signal-to-noise ratio.</aside>
<p>In some respects, the behavior of <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a> differs from that of classical intensity noise.
Even when using a perfect 50:50 beam splitter, the optical power fluctuations in the two output ports of such a device are not fully correlated with each other.
Therefore, even a perfect a balanced detector would produce some output fluctuations which are related to <a href="shot_noise.html" title="quantum-limited intensity noise">shot noise</a>.
That quantum noise limit is at least much lower than the noise level which one could achieve in many cases without balanced detection.</p>
<p>The <a href="relative_intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity (or actually power), normalized to its average value">relative intensity noise</a> at the shot noise level increases as the optical power is reduced.
Therefore, one will often try to operate the photodetectors with power levels as high as possible, limited either by the available optical powers or by the power handling capability of the detectors.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of Balanced Photodetection</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Absorption Spectroscopy</h3>
<div>
<p>As already mentioned above, one may apply balanced detection in <a href="laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="methods of absorption spectroscopy using laser light">laser absorption spectroscopy</a>.
The problem with direct detection (using a single photodetector) would be that the detector cannot distinguish between fluctuations due to <a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a> and those caused by absorption features.
A balanced photodetector can largely suppress the influence of laser noise, which is a common input for both ports &ndash; particularly if the setup is well balanced.</p>
<p>Balanced detection can also be applied in conjunction with frequency modulation spectroscopy, where absorption features cause slight changes of amplitude and phase of a laser beam, which can be revealed by comparison with a reference beam in a balanced detector.
Of course, the detector should be able to temporally resolve the modulation.</p>
<p>Similar methods can also be applied for <a href="pump_probe_measurements.html" title="techniques for investigating ultrafast phenomena, where a pump pulse excites a sample and a probe pulse is used for probing the sample after an adjustable delay time">pump&ndash;probe measurements</a>.
The inputs to the balanced detectors are of course not pump and probe beam, but rather the probe beam and a reference beam derived from it, which is not affected by the investigated sample.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Homodyne Detection</h3>
<div>
<p>In some cases, one uses balanced photodetectors after a 50:50 beam splitter for measuring <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a> of a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>, for example.
With suitable electronic circuits, one obtains the sum and the difference of the photocurrents and feeds both to an electronic spectrum analyzer.
While the sum signal reflects the laser intensity noise, just as would be obtained with a single photodetector, the difference signal indicates the shot noise level.
Therefore, one can easily compare the laser noise with the shot noise level.
In case of <a href="amplitude_squeezed_light.html" title="light with an intensity noise below the shot noise level">amplitude-squeezed light</a>, one can accurately detect sub-shot noise performance.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Interferometric Detection</h3>
<div>
<p>In various kinds of <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a> &ndash; for example, those used for <a href="optical_coherence_tomography.html" title="an optical imaging technique where longitudinal resolution is achieved based on interference effects with low-coherence light">optical coherence tomography</a> &ndash; one can substantially improve the noise performance with balanced detection.
The two balanced photodetectors receive light from the two outputs of the beam splitter where the signal beam is superimposed with the reference beam.
The difference of the photocurrents delivers the wanted interferometric signal while suppressing intensity noise of the light source.</p>
<p>Such techniques are also used for <a href="optical_heterodyne_detection.html" title="a sensitive method of photodetection, reaching the standard quantum limit even for weak signal powers">optical heterodyne detection</a> in various other applications.</p>
