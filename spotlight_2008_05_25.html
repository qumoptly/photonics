<p style="font-size:11px;">(A German version of this article appeared in the <a href="http://www.world-of-photonics.net/link/de/19814236#19814236" rel="nofollow">&quot;World of Photonics&quot; newsletter]</a> in May 2008.)</p>
<p>Albert Einstein is sometimes said to be a key person for the invention of the <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>.
Similarly, his famous equation <span class="eqn_il"><i>E</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>m&thinsp;c</i><sup>2</sup></span> is sometimes called the key to the atomic bomb.
Is that reasonable?</p>
<p>In one of this most important publications (&ldquo;Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung&rdquo;), Einstein has described the process of <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a> of radiation.
This means that a <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> hitting some atom (or ion or molecule) may not only supply energy to this atom in an absorption process, but also send an already excited atom back to a state with lower energy.
In the latter case, an additional photon is emitted.
A crucial aspect is Einstein's insight that the additional photon should move in the same direction as the incoming photon.
We thus have a process of light amplification: we get two photons out of one, or transform some light beam into a more energetic one.
Furthermore, Einstein has realized that a net gain of optical power in some ensemble of atoms can occur only if there is a so-called <a href="population_inversion.html" title="a state of a medium where a higher-lying electronic level has a higher population than a lower-lying level">population inversion</a>: the upper energy level must be more strongly populated than the lower one, so that the effect of stimulated emission can exceed the one by absorption of atoms in the lower state.
This state is often achieved by &quot;<a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">optical pumping</a>&quot; e.g. of a <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> &ndash; an invention attributed to Alfred Kastler.</p>
<p>For a laser, one more thing is required: a &quot;<a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a>&quot;, in which a light beam can circulate, and an amplifying medium (<a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>) can at least compensate for the power losses in each round trip.
This principle was first demonstrated with microwaves (in so-called <em>masers</em>), and by the ground-breaking work of Schawlow, Townes and Maiman around 1960 it could also be applied to light.</p>
<p>As the work between 1917 and 1960 has certainly brought more than only the clarification of some minor details, it would be rather far-fetched to call Einstein the inventor of the laser.
However, he has indeed realized the most important physical basis of the laser &ndash; the process of stimulated emission.
This, by the way, was done not by observing physical phenomena, but via theoretical reasoning.
After that, there was still a far way to the laser.</p>
<p>By the way, there is a similarity to the story of the nuclear bomb.
According to the equation <span class="eqn_il"><i>E</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>m&thinsp;c</i><sup>2</sup></span>, a huge amount of energy should be released when just a few grams of matter are converted to energy.
Without doubt, this is a very important finding.
Nevertheless, it is still another thing to identify a way to do this conversion.
Such a way was found via the discovery of nuclear fission by the team of Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and the realization of the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction soon after.
In this sense, Einstein is related to the atomic bomb perhaps more via his famous letter to president Roosevelt than by the mentioned equation.
And Max Planck could present an equation (<span class="eqn_il"><i>E</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>h&thinsp;<span class="greek">&nu;</span></i></span>), but no letter, and is not considered to be the father of the laser, but at most (together with Einstein) a father of the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a>, which was later named so by Gilbert N. Lewis.</p>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
