<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="effective_refractive_index.html" title="a number quantifying the phase delay per unit length in a waveguide, relative to the phase delay in vacuum">effective refractive index</a></p>
<p>While the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> of a homogeneous transparent medium is based on a rather simple concept, the <a href="effective_refractive_index.html" title="a number quantifying the phase delay per unit length in a waveguide, relative to the phase delay in vacuum">effective refractive index</a> in a <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> such as an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> is somewhat more difficult to understand &ndash; and is in fact often misunderstood.</p>
<p>In a usual <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>, the guided propagation mode extends significantly beyond the region of the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, and the effective refractive index is found to have a value somewhat between the refractive indices of core and <a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">cladding</a>.
In a <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fiber</a>, <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes">higher-order modes</a> extend more into the cladding, and have smaller effective indices.
These facts often make people believe that the effective index is a kind of weighted average of the local refractive index, according to the propagation of some parts of the total optical power in the core and in the cladding, respectively.
This picture, however, is quite wrong.</p>
<p>First consider the definition of the effective index <i>n</i><sub>eff</sub>: the <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&beta;</span></span> value of some fiber <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">mode</a> is <i>n</i><sub>eff</sub> times the vacuum <a href="wavenumber.html" title="the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumber</a>.
So that definition targets the <em>phase</em> change per unit length along the fiber axis, not the <em>intensity</em> distribution.</p>
<p>Still one might guess that there is some relation to the intensity distribution as well, but a simple example shows that this can hardly be true.
Consider a <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index</a> <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fiber</a> with high <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> (NA), i.e. with a very large index step.
In that case, all fiber modes except for the highest order ones propagate essentially only in the core, so that from this one might expect the effective index of all modes to closely match the core index.
But this is not the case: higher-order modes still have significantly lower effective indices.
They experience a smaller phase shift per unit length, even though they propagate in the same material.
How can that be?
Essentially it is the fact that higher-order modes contain more pronounced plane wave components (spatial Fourier components) with a larger angular offset from the fiber axis.
So it is here in some sense a matter of different propagation directions, not of different materials.
Of course, both effects are relevant in fibers with lower NA.</p>
<p>The figure below shows an example case: a mode of a multimode fiber has been selected, which is close to its <a href="cut_off_wavelength.html" title="a wavelength above which a guided mode of a waveguide ceases to exist">cut-off</a>.
At this point, the effective refractive index can be calculated to be very close to the cladding index &ndash; its difference to the cladding index is only 0.4&#37; of the difference between core and cladding index.
The mode field indeed penetrates further into the cladding than other modes, which are not as close to their cut-off.
Nevertheless, 68&#37; of the power still propagate within the core.</p>

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
The LP<sub>32</sub> mode of a multimode fiber at a wavelength where it is close to its cut-off.
The diagram has been produced with the <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a> software.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One detail can still be confusing: shouldn't modes with stronger off-axis field components experience a <em>larger</em> rather than a smaller phase shift per unit length, given that they somehow have to travel a larger distance?
No, that is actually not true: when the <i>k</i> vector has some angle to the fiber axis, its projection to the fiber axis becomes smaller, reducing the phase changes in that direction.
This is somewhat reminiscent of a phenomenon discussed in an <a href="spotlight_2006_11_02.html">earlier spotlight article</a>, where that aspect has been discussed in some detail.</p>
