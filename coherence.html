<p>Coherence is one of the most important concepts in optics and is strongly related to the ability of <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> to exhibit <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effects.
A light field is called <em>coherent</em> when there is a fixed <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times.
<em>Partial coherence</em> means that there is some (although not perfect) correlation between phase values.
There are various ways of quantifying the degree of coherence, as described below.</p>
<p>It is also common to call certain <em>processes</em> or <em>techniques</em> coherent or incoherent.
In that case, &ldquo;coherent&rdquo; essentially means phase-sensitive.
For example, the general method of <a href="coherent_beam_combining.html" title="a class of methods for beam combining, requiring mutual coherence of the combined beams">coherent beam combining</a> relies on the mutual coherence of beams, whereas <a href="spectral_beam_combining.html" title="a class of methods for beam combining, based on wavelength-sensitive beam combiners">spectral (incoherent) beam combining</a> does not</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Spatial Versus Temporal Coherence</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:123px;">
<img src="img/spatial_coherence.png" alt="spatial coherence">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A <a href="prisms.html" title="transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prism</a> is inserted into a spatially coherent laser beam, generating an interference pattern on the screen.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are two very different aspects of coherence:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spatial coherence</em> means a strong correlation (fixed phase relationship) between the electric fields at different locations across the beam profile.
For example, within a cross-section of a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">beam</a> from a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> with diffraction-limited <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, the electric fields at different positions oscillate in a totally correlated way, even if the temporal structure is complicated by a superposition of different frequency components.
Spatial coherence is the essential prerequisite of the strong directionality of <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>.</li>
<li><em>Temporal coherence</em> means a strong correlation between the electric fields at one location but different times.
For example, the output of a <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency laser</a> can exhibit a very high temporal coherence, as the electric field temporally evolves in a highly predictable fashion: it exhibits a clean sinusoidal oscillation over extended periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">Lasers</a> have the potential for generating <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">beams</a> (e.g. <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a>) with very high spatial coherence, and this is perhaps the most fundamental difference between <a href="laser_light.html" title="light generated with a laser device">laser light</a> and radiation from other light sources.
High spatial coherence arises from the existence of <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a>, which define spatially correlated field patterns.
In situations where only a single resonator mode has sufficient laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> to oscillate, a single longitudinal mode can be selected, obtaining <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a> with very high <em>temporal</em> coherence as well.</p>
<p>Figures 2&ndash;4 further illustrate the difference between spatial and temporal coherence.
For reference, Figure&nbsp;2 shows a <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a> <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a>, exhibiting perfect spatial and temporal coherence.</p>

Electric field distribution around the focus of a Gaussian laser beam (coming e.g. from the left side) with perfect spatial and temporal coherence.

</figure>
<p>Figure&nbsp;3 shows a beam with high spatial coherence, but poor temporal coherence.
The wavefronts are formed as above, and the beam quality is still very high, but the amplitude and <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> of the beam varies along the propagation direction.
Note that both the local amplitude and the spacing of the wavefronts vary to some extent.
Such a beam can be generated e.g. from the output of a <a href="supercontinuum_generation.html" title="a nonlinear process for strong spectral broadening of light">supercontinuum</a> source.</p>

<img src="img/laser_beam1.png" alt="laser beam with poor temporal coherence">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
A laser beam with high spatial coherence, but poor temporal coherence.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure&nbsp;4 shows a laser beam with reduced spatial coherence, but high temporal coherence.
The wavefronts are deformed, and this results in a high beam divergence and poor beam quality.
On the other hand, the beam is <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic</a>, so that the spacing of the deformed wavefronts remains constant.
Such a beam can result from a single-frequency laser, when its output is sent through some optically inhomogeneous material.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/laser_beam2.png" alt="laser beam with poor spatial coherence">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
A laser beam with poor spatial coherence, but high temporal coherence.

</figure>
<p>If a laser beam with high spatial coherence is sent through an optical <a href="diffusers.html" title="devices which scatter light such that its spatial coherence is substantially reduced">diffuser</a> element (for example, a very inhomogeneous piece of glass) which totally scrambles the wavefront, the resulting distorted beam could in principle still be considered as spatially coherent, since the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> relationship between the electric fields at different points would still be fixed, as long as the wavefront distortions do not change with time.
It would then also in principle be possible to restore a simple beam shape by applying another optical element which compensates the complicated spatial distortions.
For most practical purposes, however, such a distorted beam will be spatially incoherent.
Nevertheless, a real destruction of spatial coherence requires time-dependent wavefront distortions, as can be obtained with a rotating <a href="diffusers.html" title="devices which scatter light such that its spatial coherence is substantially reduced">diffuser</a>, for example.
In that case, the temporal coherence is also somewhat degraded.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Quantifying Coherence</h2>
<div>
<p>There are different ways to quantify the degree of coherence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correlation functions specify the degree of correlation as a function of a spatial or temporal distance.
There are correlation functions of different orders.
The first-order correlation function is related to the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>.
The second-order correlation function describes intensity correlations, i.e., effects like <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> bunching or anti-bunching.
Higher-order functions describe still more subtle details.</li>
<li>The <a href="coherence_time.html" title="a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the time over which the field correlation decays">coherence time</a> quantifies the degree of first-order temporal coherence via the time over which coherence is lost.</li>
<li>The <a href="coherence_length.html" title="a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the propagation distance over which the coherence significantly decays">coherence length</a> is the <a href="coherence_time.html" title="a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the time over which the field correlation decays">coherence time</a> times the vacuum <a href="velocity_of_light.html" title="the velocity with which light propagates in a medium">velocity of light</a>, and thus also characterizes the temporal (not spatial!) coherence via the propagation length (and thus propagation time) over which coherence is lost.</li>
<li>The <a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> of a <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency laser</a> is also strongly related to temporal coherence: a narrow linewidth (high monochromaticity) means high temporal coherence.</li>
<li>Fringe visibility parameters essentially specify the visibility (contrast) of an <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> pattern generated by superposition of two electric fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship between optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> and temporal coherence can be non-trivial.
For example, a <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">pulse</a> train from a <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a> can have a broad overall bandwidth, with the <a href="spotlight_2007_10_11.html">Fourier spectrum</a> consisting of discrete very narrow lines (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="frequency_combs.html" title="optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines"><em>frequency combs</em></a>).
The temporal coherence can be very high in the sense that there are strong field correlations for large time delays which are close to integer multiples of the pulse period.
(See also the discussion on the coherence of <a href="supercontinuum_generation.html" title="a nonlinear process for strong spectral broadening of light">supercontinua</a>, and the <a href="spotlight_2006_09_22.html">article concerning coherence of ultrashort pulses</a> in the <a href="spotlight.html">Photonics Spotlight</a>.)</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Importance of Coherence in Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>Some <a href="laser_applications.html" title="applications involving laser devices">applications</a> need light with very high spatial and temporal coherence.
This applies, e.g., to many variations of <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometry</a>, <a href="holography.html" title="methods for recording and reconstructing three-dimensional images">holography</a>, and some types of <a href="optical_sensors.html" title="sensors based on optical principles, or sensors for light">optical sensors</a> (e.g. <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a>).
Such features are also important for the technique of <a href="coherent_beam_combining.html" title="a class of methods for beam combining, requiring mutual coherence of the combined beams">coherent beam combining</a>.</p>
<p>For other applications, the coherence of the light used should be as <em>low</em> as possible.
For example, very low temporal coherence (but combined with high spatial coherence) is required for <a href="optical_coherence_tomography.html" title="an optical imaging technique where longitudinal resolution is achieved based on interference effects with low-coherence light"><em>optical coherence tomography</em></a>, where images are created with a kind of interferometry, and a high spatial resolution requires low temporal coherence.
Suitable light sources for such applications can be based on <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> (ASE) from a <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">laser amplifier</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="superluminescent_sources.html" title="optical sources based on superluminescence"><em>superluminescent sources</em></a>) or on <a href="supercontinuum_generation.html" title="a nonlinear process for strong spectral broadening of light">supercontinuum generation</a> in nonlinear media.
A low degree of temporal coherence can also be beneficial for laser projection displays, <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> and <a href="laser_pointers.html" title="devices used for pointing at items with laser beams">pointer</a> applications, as it reduces the tendency for <a href="laser_speckle.html" title="light patterns resulting from the reflection of coherent light at rough surfaces">laser speckle</a> and similar interference effects.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Coherence in Quantum Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>In <a href="quantum_optics.html" title="the part of optics which deals with quantum effects">quantum optics</a>, the term <em>coherence</em> is often used for the state of light-emitting atoms or ions.
In that case, coherence refers to a phase relationship between the complex amplitudes corresponding to electronic states.
This is important, e.g., in the context of <a href="lasing_without_inversion.html" title="the quantum-optical phenomenon of laser emission occurring without the presence of a population inversion">lasing without inversion</a>.
There is also the term &ldquo;<a href="coherent_states.html" title="a special kind of pure quantum-mechanical states of light">coherent states</a>&rdquo; of the light field, which has yet another meaning.</p>
