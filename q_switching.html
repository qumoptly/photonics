<p>Q switching is a technique for obtaining energetic short (but not <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort</a>) <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a> from a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> by modulating the intracavity losses and thus the <a href="q_factor.html" title="a measure of the damping of resonator modes"><i>Q</i> factor</a> of the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.
The technique is mainly applied for the generation of <a href="nanosecond_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting optical pulses with nanosecond durations">nanosecond</a> pulses of high <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">energy</a> and <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> with <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>.</p>
<p>The generation of a Q-switched pulse (sometimes called a <em>giant pulse</em>) can be described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, the <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">resonator</a> losses are kept at a high level.
As lasing cannot occur at that time, the energy fed into the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> by the pumping mechanism accumulates there.
The amount of stored energy is often limited only by <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> (particularly for continuous pumping), in other cases (with strong enough <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>) by the onset of lasing or strong <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">ASE</a>, if not simply by the pump energy available.
The stored energy can be a multiple of the <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation energy</a>.</li>
<li>Then, the losses are suddenly (with active or passive means, see below) reduced to a small value, so that the power of the laser radiation builds up very quickly in the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.
This process typically starts with <a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">noise</a> from <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a>, which is amplified to macroscopic power levels within hundreds or thousands of resonator round trips.</li>
<li>Once the temporally integrated intracavity power has reached the order of the saturation energy of the gain medium, the gain starts to be <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">saturated</a>.
The peak of the pulse is reached when the gain equals the remaining (low) resonator losses.
The large intracavity power present at that time leads to further depletion of the stored energy during the time where the power decays.
In many cases, the energy extracted after the pulse maximum is similar to that before the pulse maximum.</li>
</ul>

This video, developed in a cooperation between RP Photonics and <a href="http://catalog.cuttingedgeoptronics.com/viewitems/solid-state-lasers/dpss-lasers?utm_source=RP-Photonics&amp;utm_medium=Q-Switched%20Lasers%20Video&amp;utm_campaign=RP-Photonics%20Encyclopedia%20Videos">Cutting Edge Optronics</a>, explains the principle of Q switching.
</p>
<p>The <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> achieved with Q switching is typically in the nanosecond range (corresponding to several <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> round trips), and usually well above the resonator round-trip time.
The energy of the generated pulse is typically higher than the <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation energy</a> of the gain medium and can be in the millijoule range even for small lasers.
The <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> can be orders of magnitude higher than the power which is achievable in <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a>.
Even for lasers with moderate size and with moderate focusing of the beam, the peak intensity can be sufficient for <a href="laser_induced_breakdown.html" title="a kind of spark, initiated by intense laser light">optical breakdown</a> in air.</p>
<p>In most cases, Q-switched lasers generate regular pulse trains via <em>repetitive Q switching</em>.
The <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a> is typically in the range from 1&ndash;100 kHz, sometimes higher.
Passively Q-switched <a href="microchip_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers with a quasi-monolithic setup">microchip lasers</a> have reached pulse durations far below 1&nbsp;ns and repetition rates up to several megahertz, whereas large (typically <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplified</a>) laser systems can deliver pulses with many kilojoules of energy and durations in the nanosecond range.</p>
<p>Lasers to which the Q-switching technique is applied are called <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching"><em>Q-switched lasers</em></a>.
The first experimental demonstrations were performed in 1961 at Hughes Aircraft Company [2], shortly after the demonstration of the first laser in the same laboratory.</p>
<p>The resonator losses can basically be switched in different ways:</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Active Q Switching</h2>
<div>
<p>For <em>active</em> Q switching (Figure&nbsp;1), the losses are modulated with an active control element (<em>active <a href="q_switches.html" title="optical switches which are typically used for generating nanosecond pulses in lasers">Q switch</a></em>), typically either an <a href="acousto_optic_q_switches.html" title="acousto-optic modulators used for Q switching of lasers">acousto-optic</a> or <a href="electro_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic modulator</a>.
Here, the pulse is formed shortly after an electrical trigger signal arrives.
There are also mechanical Q switches such as spinning mirrors, used as end mirrors of laser resonators.
In any case, the achieved pulse energy and pulse duration depends on the energy stored in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>, i.e. on the pump power and the <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/active_q_switching.png" alt="gain and loss in an actively Q-switched laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Temporal evolution of gain and losses in an actively Q-switched laser.
The Q switch is activated at <span class="eqn_il"><i>t</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0</span>.
The power starts to rise exponentially at this point, but becomes high only after &asymp;&thinsp;0.2&nbsp;&mu;s.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Interestingly, the switching time of the modulator does <em>not</em> need to be comparable to the pulse duration &ndash; it can be much longer than that, since it takes many resonator round trips for an intense pulse to be formed.
If it is too long, however, this may lead to <a href="double_pulses.html" title="two closely spaced optical pulses">double pulses</a> or to certain instabilities.</p>
<p>The beam deflection angle of the Q-switch must be large enough such that the diffracted beam really leaves the resonator.
In some cases, this leads to the demand of a high drive frequency of the Q-switch &ndash; e.g. 80&nbsp;MHz, while 40&nbsp;MHz is sufficient for other lasers.
Critical cases are those with large <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> within the Q-switch.</p>
<p>For many applications, Q-switched pulses are generated in a periodic fashion, i.e., with a given <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a>.
A Q-switch driver may contain an oscillator (or a digital device) for periodically triggering the pulse generation, or receive a periodic trigger signal (often with TTL format) from an external device.
In some cases, a TTL input only indicates to the driver whether or not the periodic pulse train should be generated (with the timing determined by the driver itself).
Some drivers have an analog input, allowing for the continuous control of Q-switch transmission.</p>
<aside class="callout green">How to avoid problems with super-intense first pulses?</aside>
<p>In some <a href="laser_applications.html" title="applications involving laser devices">laser applications</a>, such as <a href="laser_marking.html" title="a group of methods for labeling materials with lasers">laser marking</a>, the Q-switched pulse train must be switched off for certain time intervals, while the pumping of the laser gain medium continues.
This leads to a stronger accumulation of stored energy in the gain medium (compared with the situation of periodic pulse generation).
Therefore, if one enables the pulse generation again, particularly the first pulse may require a substantially higher energy than in steady-state pulsing.
Because the pulse duration is also decreased, the peak power rises even more.
Those factors may lead to <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">laser-induced damage</a> either of laser components or any external objects, and they may disturb the process for which the pulses are used.
To avoid such problems, one can either reduce the pump power during the times without pulse generation or take measures to introduce additional losses for the first few pulses.
A common technique is to use the active Q-switch for that: instead of being fully switched off for pulse generation, it is only reduced in power, such that some substantial transmission losses remain, which correspondingly reduce the pulse energy.
(Some Q-switch drivers offer such functionality.)
The excess energy then goes into the diffracted beam, which may be safely disposed with a <a href="beam_dumps.html" title="devices for blocking and absorbing light beams">beam dump</a>.
An alternative unique is to pull down the stored energy by low-power lasing before the next pulse train begins; that can be achieved by slowly increasing the Q-switch transmission.</p>
<p>The <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a> of an actively Q-switched laser can be controlled via the modulator.
Higher repetition rates typically lead to lower pulse energies, if the pump power is kept constant.
At the same time, the pulses then become longer, as the initial laser gain becomes lower.
For very high repetition rates, some pulses may be missing in the pulse train, if the gain cannot recover in time.
For very low repetition rates, one may obtain rather short high-energy pulses, but once the pulse period exceeds the upper-state lifetime, increasing losses via <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> limit the possible pulse energy.</p>
<p>The duration of the generated pulses is at least of the order of the resonator round-trip time, and often substantially longer than that, if the laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and/or the resonator losses are low.
Particularly for high pulse repetition rates, it can be difficult to obtain very short pulses.
This problem can be solved by using the method of <a href="cavity_dumping.html" title="a method for extracting intense short or ultrashort pulses from a laser, using an optical switch in the laser resonator">cavity dumping</a>.
Instead of using an ordinary output coupler mirror, the pulse generation phase is effectively done with a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; low-loss resonator.
Once most of the stored energy has been transferred into the circulating pulse, the energy is suddenly released with the cavity dumper, which is a fast optical switch.
In that way, the optical energy in the resonator can be extracted within one resonator round-trip time, independent of the time required for pulse build-up.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Passive Q Switching</h2>
<div>
<p>For <em>passive</em> Q switching (sometimes called <em>self Q switching</em>), the losses are automatically modulated with a <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a> (Figure&nbsp;2).
Here, the pulse is formed as soon as the energy stored in the gain medium (and thus the <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>) has reached a sufficiently high level.
In many cases, the pulse energy and duration are then fixed, and changes of the pump power only influence the pulse repetition rate.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/passive_q_switching.png" alt="gain and loss in a passively Q-switched laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Temporal evolution of gain and losses in a passively Q-switched laser.
Shortly after the laser gain exceeds the resonator losses, a short pulse is emitted.
Once the absorber starts to be saturated, the power rises rapidly, until the gain is saturated to the level of the resonator losses (here: 10&#37;).

<p>A frequently used saturable absorber material for passive Q switching of 1-&mu;m <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">YAG lasers</a> is Cr<sup>4+</sup>:YAG.
For 1.5-&mu;m <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium</a> lasers, there are Co<sup>2+</sup>:MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Co<sup>2+</sup>:ZnSe and other cobalt-doped crystals, and glasses which are doped with PbS <a href="quantum_dots.html" title="microscopic structures confining charge carriers in three dimensions">quantum dots</a>.
V<sup>3+</sup>:YAG crystals are suitable for the 1.3-&mu;m region.
<a href="semiconductor_saturable_absorber_mirrors.html" title="saturable semiconductor absorber devices acting as nonlinear mirrors">Semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors</a> can be applied at various wavelengths.</p>
<p>The recovery time of a saturable absorber is ideally longer than the pulse duration, so that additional unnecessary energy losses by are avoided.
However, the absorber should be fast enough to prevent premature lasing when the gain recovers.
Typically, a recovery time somewhere between the pulse duration and the <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a> of the gain medium is ideal.</p>
<p>In principle, a saturable absorber may absorb only a minor fraction of the energy of the generated pulses, i.e., the absorber does not necessarily reduce the <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">power efficiency</a> of the laser.
This is at least possible if the <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation energy</a> of the absorber is well below that of the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> and the absorber exhibits negligible non-saturable losses.
However, significant non-saturable losses are often encountered in real absorbers, and practical limitations such as <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage thresholds</a> may make it impossible to strongly reduce the absorber's saturation energy by using strong focusing.
Therefore, the power efficiency is in practice often significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Compared with active Q switching, passive Q switching is simple and cost-effective (eliminating the modulator and its electronics), and is suitable for very high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a>.
However, the pulse energies are typically lower.
Also, external triggering of the pulses is not possible (except with an optical pulse from another source), and it may also be a disadvantage that the pulse energy and duration are often more or less independent of the pump power, which only determines the pulse repetition rate.</p>

<p>For both active and passive Q switching, higher pulse repetition rates usually imply longer pulses.
This is because the reduced pulse energy leads to a weaker modulation of the net gain, and thus to a slower rise and decay of the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
When the pulse repetition rate of an actively Q-switched laser falls below the inverse <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>, the maximum pulse energy is achieved, but the average power is reduced due to increased losses via <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> (<a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a>).</p>
<p>Pumping does not have to occur in a continuous-wave fashion; it is also possible to use pulsed pumping with <a href="flash_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps which are used for generating intense light pulses">flash lamps</a> or <a href="quasi_continuous_wave_operation.html" title="an operation mode of lasers (e.g. diode bars) where the pump power is switched on for short time intervals in order to limit thermal effects">quasi-cw</a> <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>, fired shortly before the Q switch is opened.
This reduces the energy losses via spontaneous emission and thus allows the use of gain media with shorter <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetimes</a>.</p>
<p>In most cases, the pulses in a Q-switched laser are generated by amplifying noise from <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> in many resonator round trips.
Therefore, there is usually no <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> correlation between subsequent pulses, and the pattern of excited <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> can be random.
Moreover, excitation of multiple <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> results in the generation of <a href="beat_note.html" title="an oscillation of the optical intensity arising from the superposition of light with different optical frequencies">beat notes</a>, apparent as fast modulations on the Q-switched pulse envelope.
In some cases, however, a Q-switched laser is seeded e.g. with the output of a small <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency</a> <a href="seed_lasers.html" title="lasers which are used for generating some seed light into an amplifier or another laser">seed laser</a> in order to obtain a low-noise single-frequency output, avoiding beat notes and reducing the noise overall (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="injection_seeding.html" title="a technique for enforcing narrowband operation of a laser or optical parametric oscillator by injecting light into its resonator"><em>injection seeding</em></a>).
It is also possible to generate such a seed in the laser itself (<em>self-injection seeding</em>) from <em>prelasing</em> at a low power level.</p>
<p>The nonlinear <a href="laser_dynamics.html" title="the temporal evolution of quantities such as the optical power and gain in a laser">dynamics</a> of Q switching sometimes lead to unexpected phenomena, such as the generation of <a href="double_pulses.html" title="two closely spaced optical pulses">double pulses</a> and/or certain instabilities.
Numerical simulations of pulse generation can be very helpful in understanding such effects and identifying the right cure.</p>
<p>Note that the high <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a> and <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a> obtained with Q switching can raise serious <a href="laser_safety.html" title="safety of the use of laser devices">laser safety</a> issues even for lasers with fairly small average output power.
Also, the <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a> can become high enough to destroy intracavity optical elements such as <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a>.
It can therefore be necessary to use a <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a> which avoids any strongly focused beams on optical components &ndash; which can be challenging particularly for short laser resonators (as are desirable for short pulses) with large mode areas.
Further, a Q-switched laser has to be kept very clean in order to avoid the burning of dust particles.</p>
