<p>Author: <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/paschotta.html" rel="author">Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta</a>, <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/">RP Photonics Consulting GmbH</a></p>
<p>Abstract: We encourage researchers and company people to provide photographs, drawings and videos for use in our Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology. Readers like that, and the contributors obtain a fair recognition.</p>
</div>
<figure class="right" style="width:130px;">
<img src="img/paschotta5.jpg" alt="Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta">
</figure>
<p>Today I would like to make you aware of the possibility to contribute photographs, drawings and videos to the <a href="encyclopedia.html">Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology</a>.
Most illustrations there have been made by ourselves, but we have limited opportunities for making nice photographs of components and laser systems, for example.
Therefore, we are happy to publish photographs and videos provided by others &ndash; for example, by researchers and laser companies.</p>
<p>In the following, I summarize the conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any materials should be such that contribute to the technical understanding of the relevant matter and do not primarily have an advertising character.
Therefore, we do not accept images which dominantly shows things like company logos rather than relevant technical details.</li>
<li>In the figure caption, we always properly acknowledge the source of the materials.
We may write something like &ldquo;The photograph was kindly provided by Daniel Stepper from the Next Step Photonics Institute&rdquo;, where the person and/or institute name may be equipped with an html link (with nofollow tag, i.e., directing people but not <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engine">search engines</a> to your website).</li>
<li>There is no money involved.
You will neither have to pay for getting some publicity, nor will we pay you for providing the materials.
That keeps things really simple.</li>
<li>You must of course make sure that no copyright or similar is violated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some ideas for suitable materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can use photographs of optical components, setups containing multiple components and fabrication equipment.</li>
<li>There are also beautiful things like <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscope</a> images, showing an example of what can be achieved with a certain technique.</li>
<li>Technical drawings can also be very useful.
For example, I could imagine a drawing which illustrates the operation principle of a WDM communications system or the structure of a <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifier</a>.</li>
<li>Videos are welcome.
As an example, see our encyclopedia article on <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a>, where we have published a video which nicely illustrates the operation principle of such a laser.
In particular, you can see there how one can realize a large number of passes of the pump radiation through the disk, using only a few relatively simple optical components.
Our article on <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a> contains another video, illustrating how that method works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such cooperations really create a lot of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our readers are of course happy to obtain not only good explanations in words, but also beautiful and helpful images.</li>
<li>We at RP Photonics are glad to keep our large user community very happy.
We indirectly profit from the enormous popularity of our resource, including not only the encyclopedia but also the <a href="buyersguide.html">RP Photonics Buyer's Guide</a>.</li>
<li>As a contributor of such materials, you can also obtain some fair recognition.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I will be glad to receive your suggestions for the publication of such materials!</p>

<h2>Photonics in Times of Trouble for International Trade</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">This <a href="./spotlight_2017_02_17.html?banner=International_trade">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> addresses the current serious concerns about the future of international trade and more generally international cooperation. Some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>German trade surplus</b> deserves attention, but claiming unfair practices without differentiating between different sectors of the economy is just stupid talk.</li>
<li>Already announced changes of US policy constitute a serious threat of beginning <b>trade wars</b>, which could have disastrous consequences.</li>
<li>There are also <b>ruthless attacks on essential values</b>, contributing to a breakdown of cooperation.</li>
<li>If we do not stop these developments in time, we may get into the <b>big crunch</b>.</li>
<li>We must <b>fiercely defend fundamental values</b> as well as <b>international cooperation</b>, because this is the only chance to solve a wide range of serious problems.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:14px;">You are welcome to <a href="./spotlight_2017_02_17.html?banner=International_trade">read the article</a>. Note that you can get the <a href="./spotlight.html?banner=International_trade">Photonics Spotlight</a> as an e-mail newsletter.</p>
