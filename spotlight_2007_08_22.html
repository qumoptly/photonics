<p>Abstract: Pump saturation effects in laser gain media are often ignored. In many cases, this can be justified, because such effects are rather weak. However, this is not always the case. The article illustrates this with some examples.</p>

<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a></p>
<p>When saturation in <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> or <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a> is discussed, this happens most often in the context of <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a>.
However, there can also be saturation of <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a>: the efficiency of pump absorption (and thus also the <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a>) can be reduced, essentially by bleaching of the ground state population of the laser-active ions or atoms.</p>
<p>The question is then whether such effects are strong enough to be worth consideration.
Here are some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a typical <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG laser</a>, the signal power circulating in the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> leads to an intensity in the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> which is a few times the <a href="saturation_power.html" title="a measure of the incident optical power required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation intensity</a>.
Compared to the circulating laser intensity, the pump intensity is normally much smaller.
Furthermore, the saturation intensity of Nd:YAG related to pump absorption (at 808&nbsp;nm) is several times higher than the gain saturation intensity at 1064&nbsp;nm.
Consequently, pump saturation effects cannot be strong.</li>
<li>Pump saturation during laser operation is also deemed to be weak in cases where laser operation starts as soon as only a tiny fraction of the laser-active ions is excited.
Laser operation then clamps the upper-state population, so that strong ground state depletion is not possible.
This is the case in many (but not all) four-level lasers.</li>
<li>Local pump saturation (e.g. at the pumped end of a laser crystal) does not inevitably have an important impact on the performance, since the lower pump absorption at some locations may be compensated by the resulting higher pump intensity at other locations.
What matters is often only how much power is absorbed altogether, but not where exactly.</li>
<li>In a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a>, pump saturation effects may be stronger, because (a) no lasing occurs before the pulse build-up, and (b) because minimization of the pulse width often leads one to apply a relatively high pump intensity.
The latter also applies to lasers operating on weaker transitions, such as the 1.3-&mu;m transition of Nd:YAG.</li>
<li><a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">Quasi-three-level lasers</a> require the excitation of a substantial fraction of the laser-active ions.
Therefore, significant pump saturation effects often occur in such devices.
Extreme effects can occur in true three-level lasers.</li>
<li>Particularly strong pump saturation occurs in cases where both the absorption <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a> and the applied pump intensities are rather high.
An example is an <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a> pumped around 975&nbsp;nm (at the strong ytterbium absorption peak).
Such a device may be operated with a pump intensity far above its pump saturation intensity, and this can lead to peculiar saturation behavior: the pump power decays about linearly (rather than exponentially) in the fiber, and the slope of this decay can be substantially increased if the signal intensity is also high.
Furthermore, the saturation characteristics for the signal wave can also be strongly modified, because ions undergoing <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a> can be quickly returned to the upper laser level.</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples show that a general statement on the importance of pump saturation effects should not be made.
Often enough, you may ignore such effects, but it is good to know where.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2009_10_19.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
