</header>
<p>This article covers both custom optical elements and custom optical assemblies or systems &ndash; beginning with the former.</p>
<p>Many optical elements such as <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>, <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a>, <a href="prisms.html" title="transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prisms</a> and <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a> are <a href="optical_fabrication.html" title="the fabrication of optical components like lenses, prisms and mirrors">fabricated</a> as standard parts, i.e., they are made with the same specifications for many different customers.
Often, they are even available from stock, i.e., manufactured even before concrete orders are coming in.
However, this concept would not work for very special parts, which need to be specifically designed and produced for individual customers.
They can be called <em>custom optical elements</em>.
The same considerations apply to other parts like <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> and optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples for custom optical elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="prisms.html" title="transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prisms</a> with special forms, fitting into special housings for compact optical setups</li>
<li>custom <a href="dichroic_mirrors.html" title="mirrors with significantly different reflection or transmission properties at two different wavelengths">dichroic mirrors</a>, <a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">dielectric coatings</a> and <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filters</a> with very special specifications, e.g. involving unusual optical wavelengths (e.g. in the area of <a href="infrared_optics.html" title="optical elements and systems which are suitable for infrared light">infrared optics</a>) or special geometrical shapes</li>
<li>optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> with special combinations of parameters like <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> size, <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, outer diameter, or with special <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">optical glass</a> or coating materials or unusual core shapes</li>
<li><a href="composite_laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals consisting of several parts of different materials or with different chemical compositions (e.g. doping concentrations)">composite laser crystals</a> with special dopants and doping profiles, geometric shapes etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a supplier may have parts on stock which are not listed in their product catalogue, e.g. because the available quantities are too small, or the parts are going to be phased out.
Therefore, the absence of parts and catalogues does not prove that stock optics are required.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Turning Stock Optics into Custom Optics</h3>
<div>
<p>Custom optical elements are sometimes fabricated not &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo;, but rather by applying additional processing steps to custom elements; some typical examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom coatings: uncoated lenses may be kept on stock in order to equip them with custom coatings later on.</li>
<li>Surface figure improvement or surface modification: uncoated standard spherical lenses may be upgraded for higher precision or even turned into <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric lenses</a> by removing parts of their surfaces.</li>
<li>Modification of dimensions: one may e.g. remove some outer parts without affecting the optical performance, such that an optical element fits into a predefined mount.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Sorted Optics</h3>
<div>
<p>Optical elements are often fabricated with an accuracy which surpasses the usually required specifications e.g. in terms of <a href="wavefronts.html" title="surfaces connecting points with the same phase of a wave">wavefront</a> error, centration or coating performance.
A manufacturer may then identify those individuals which would adhere to stricter specifications and sell them as custom precision parts.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Custom Optical Systems</h2>
<div>
<p>More complex optical arrangements, consisting of multiple optical elements, are also available in standard versions (e.g. as on-stock <a href="microscope_objectives.html" title="the optical component of a microscope which is next to the observed object">microscope</a> or <a href="cameras.html" title="optical instruments for recording still or moving images">camera</a> <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objectives</a>) or alternatively as custom versions.
The latter may or may not require custom optical elements.
In many cases, it is sufficient to appropriately combine available standard optical elements to obtain the required custom optical setup.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers offer custom optical components only, while others offer optical assemblies or systems, based on components from own production or from other sources.</p>
<p>Examples for custom optical systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>special <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objectives</a> for <a href="infrared_cameras.html" title="cameras which work with infrared light">infrared cameras</a> or inspection systems</li>
<li>laser beam delivery systems for given beam diameters, wavelengths, focusing requirements etc., possibly also with given outer dimensions and a mechanical interface to a certain laser device</li>
<li>endoscopes for medical applications</li>
<li><a href="spectrometers.html" title="devices for separating spectral components">spectrometers</a> for applications like <a href="optical_coherence_tomography.html" title="an optical imaging technique where longitudinal resolution is achieved based on interference effects with low-coherence light">optical coherence tomography</a> or <a href="optical_sensors.html" title="sensors based on optical principles, or sensors for light">optical sensors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides optical components, such systems usually contain some <a href="opto_mechanics.html" title="mechanical elements used in optics">opto-mechanics</a>, e.g. precise holders, possibly with adjustment screws and the like.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Components or systems with many essential parameters are less likely to be found as suitable standard optics.</aside>
<p>The more essential parameters an optical component or assembly has, the less likely it is that standard parts or assemblies can provide a satisfactory solution.
For example, an optical <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> has only few essential parameters such as <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a>, <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> and usable wavelength range, so that one can often use standard lenses from stock, if there are no special requirements (e.g. for <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric optics</a>).
On the other hand, <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a> have many essential parameters such as <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> radius, <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, pump cladding shape and size (for <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a>), <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a> of the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, details of chemical compositions etc.
There may just be too many dimensions of the space in which such items can be arranged; therefore, from-stock fibers often do not perfectly fulfill requirements.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Using Standard vs. Custom Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Obviously, it is advantageous in some respects to work with standard components and assemblies only:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are in most cases substantially cheaper, providing better value for money.</li>
<li class="ta_left">They can be obtained more quickly (low lead times), possibly even from stock.</li>
<li class="ta_left">They have possibly been tested more thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, an optical designer will usually try to work with standard components only.
However, custom optical elements and arrangements are required in many cases because an application can work only with them.
Due to the higher cost and longer waiting times, it is then particularly important to very carefully work out designs, minimizing the risk that the system does not work and custom elements or arrangements need to be modified again, incurring high additional cost and long time delays.
For example, one may use optical design software for comprehensive tests, which involve not only the basic optical functions but also the effects of fabrication tolerances.</p>
<aside class="callout red">In some cases, custom optics are even the cheaper solution! It is not always all about special properties and higher precision.</aside>
<p>The differences between custom optics and standard optics concerning price, delivery times etc. depend on the production volumes.
While the disadvantages of custom optics may be severe when using only small volumes, the difference can be much smaller in high-volume applications.
One may sometimes even reduce production cost with custom optics, since the design can exactly address the concrete requirements, omitting any features which are not actually required.</p>
<p>In some cases, one largely uses stock optics for prototyping of optical setups, accepting certain performance limitations, and later on partly uses custom optics for final development and mass production.
That way, the development time and cost may be reduced.
However, some uncertainties may be introduced by later changes of optical components, so that additional tests and possibly refinements are required.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Cost Models for Custom Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Particularly in cases where large production volumes are not guaranteed from start, manufacturers may apply special cost models involving non-recurring initial charges.
This is because there are often substantial initial expenses for the manufacturer, which need to be recovered, and may not be recovered without additional initial charges:</p>
<ul>
<li>design cost: calculating a suitable optical layout, checking tolerances, developing the required <a href="opto_mechanics.html" title="mechanical elements used in optics">opto-mechanics</a> etc.</li>
<li>tooling cost: applies if special tools need to be made for production</li>
<li>work for refining specifications, possibly analyzing details of the intended application, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, a manufacturer may simply quote a low number of items at a relatively high price and later larger numbers at a substantial lower per-item price.</p>
<p>A manufacturer may be tempted to quote relatively low non-recurring charges, hoping to acquire later large orders later on, but then also facing the risk of working on non-economical conditions.
The desired large volumes may not materialize even due to completely external and not foreseeable reasons.</p>
<p>The cost of custom optics can substantially depend on the strictness of specifications (see below), but also on the accepted lead time.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Custom Optics Specialists</h2>
<div>
<p>Some suppliers are specialized on producing custom objects, often only in specific fields such as <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>, <a href="prisms.html" title="transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prisms</a> or <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric optics</a>.
A specialist in a certain area can often produce custom optics at more competitive prices and/or with better performance than a generalist.
This may not only be due to specialized experience, but also because specialized machinery and tools are ready to be used.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Custom Optical Assemblies as OEM Parts</h2>
<div>
<p>Custom optical assemblies are often provided as OEM parts (<em>Original Equipment Manufacturing</em>).
An OEM manufacturer may provide such assemblies to a system integrator, who integrates them into larger devices.
The manufacturer may take over not only the responsibility for producing the assemblies, but also some additional responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>designing the assemblies</li>
<li class="ta_left">ensuring quality control (including that for optical components procured elsewhere) concerning optical performance, environmental fortitude and possibly other aspects, using sophisticated instruments for optical characterization and delivering reliable compliance reports and other documentation</li>
<li class="ta_left">keeping certain numbers in stock for avoiding delivery bottlenecks</li>
<li class="ta_left">supporting personnel of the integrator in certain aspects</li>
</ul>
<p>Contractual arrangements may also require that designs are kept confidential and no other customers are served with a certain range of custom products.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Specifications for Custom Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>When custom optics are ordered, it is particularly essential to agree with the manufacturers on comprehensive and precise specifications.
These can be related to a substantial number of aspects:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Substantial work may be required to work out detailed specifications for custom optics, but it can be essential to do that work properly.</aside>
<ul>
<li>optical parameters like <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a>, <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, <a href="field_of_view.html" title="the angular extent of the field which can be observed with an optical instruments or the eye">field of view</a>, <a href="reflectance.html" title="the ratio of reflected optical power to the incident optical power at some reflecting object">reflectance</a> etc.</li>
<li>precision, tolerances e.g. for wavefront errors</li>
<li>geometric dimensions (e.g. if parts must fit into some given holders)</li>
<li>properties of coatings (e.g. <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coatings</a>)</li>
<li>optical damage threshold (particularly for <a href="pulsed_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting light in the form of pulses">pulsed laser</a> applications)</li>
<li>used <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">optical materials</a> (ROHS compliant?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Adequate tolerancing &ndash; based on accurate calculations involving the real requirements rather than only a &ldquo;gut feeling&rdquo; &ndash; can be essential not only for obtaining the required performance but also for keeping the cost reasonably low by avoiding over-tolerancing.
This is of course most important in cases with large production volumes.</p>
<p>It can also be very helpful e.g. to use only certain preferred curvature radii, for which suitable manufacturing tools are existing already.</p>
<p>Manufacturers for custom optics are often prepared to assist in the process of refining specifications.
It is in their own interest to obtain clear specifications, avoiding any misunderstanding.
Besides, they often have a more detailed knowledge of fabrication details influencing the cost or performance details which may cause problems after integration.</p>

<h2>The Transparent Laser</h2>
<p>The dream of each laser developer, and not only of each laser scientist: have a <b>transparent laser</b>, where you can <b>look into any components</b> and see e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>optical intensities</li>
<li>excitation densities of laser-active ions</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and this at any location and time, with arbitrary resolution!</p>
<p>If you had this, finally you could</p>
<ul>
<li>fully understand what goes on in your laser,</li>
<li>quickly identify and fix any problems, and</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">make faster progress <br> while saving a lot of money.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely marvelous, but only a dream?!?</p>
<p>Good news: such transparent lasers can be made!
