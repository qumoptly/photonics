<p>Author: <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/paschotta.html" rel="author">Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta</a>, <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/">RP Photonics Consulting GmbH</a></p>
<p>Abstract: Many believe that a short upper-state lifetime of a laser crystal is beneficial for Q switching at high repetition rates. This article shows, however, that this is not true. What is essential is a high emission cross section, and a short upper-state lifetime may just result from that.</p>
</div>
<figure class="right" style="width:130px;">
<img src="img/paschotta5.jpg" alt="Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta">
</figure>
<p>It is quite well known than when building a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a> for operation with a high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a> (e.g. 100&nbsp;kHz), an Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> is better suited than a Nd:YAG crystal.
What is not so well known, however, is the reason for that.</p>
<p>Many believe that the shorter <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a> of Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> is the reason.
This is wrong, however.
The perhaps most compelling proof of that statement is obtained by considering a hypothetical laser crystal which has the same properties as Nd:YAG except that its upper-state lifetime is strongly reduced (e.g. by some <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> process); one could demonstrate with a numerical model, for example, that this would not work better (even worse!) than Nd:YAG.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a hypothetical laser crystal with the properties of Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, except for a long upper-state lifetime as for Nd:YAG, would work well &ndash; only that such a combination is physically not possible, since the upper-state lifetime cannot be longer than the <a href="radiative_lifetime.html" title="lifetime of an electronic state in the (hypothetical) situation where only radiative processes depopulate that level">radiative lifetime</a>: the lifetime is limited by the population decay through <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a>.</p>
<p>The real problem with Nd:YAG for operation at high pulse repetition rates is totally different and not related to the upper-state lifetime.
In this regime, there is only very limited time for pumping between the emission of two pulses.
Therefore, one can deposit only a quite limited amount of energy in the laser crystal, and consequently one obtains a rather small laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>.
This leads to a slow rise of optical power after opening the <a href="q_switches.html" title="optical switches which are typically used for generating nanosecond pulses in lasers">Q switch</a>.
The resulting pulse than exhibits a rather long <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> and correspondingly low <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a>; it can even happen that the available time is not sufficient for generating the pulse, so that only e.g. every second pulse is emitted: the laser operates with a lower pulse repetition rate than desired.
One may also obtain an unstable regime.</p>
<p>The described problem is much reduced when using Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, because that gain medium has a much higher <a href="gain_efficiency.html" title="small-signal gain of an optical amplifier per unit pump power or per unit stored energy">gain efficiency</a>: it delivers more <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a> of gain per millijoule of stored energy.
The high gain efficiency results from a very high emission cross section (roughly 4 times higher than for Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p>The above-described misconception may be related to the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is true that a short upper-state lifetime can be a problem for operation with low repetition rates (limited energy storage).
This does not imply, however, that a long upper-state lifetime is bad for high repetition rates.</li>
<li>Gain media with high emission cross sections tend to have short upper-state lifetimes.
However, the short upper-state lifetime is then just another consequence, rather than the reason for the better laser performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>One could also increase the gain efficiency by working with a reduced mode area in the laser crystal.
However, there are limits to this approach, set e.g. by the limited pump <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> (particularly for <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power lasers</a>) or by <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal effects</a>.</p>
<p>For designing such lasers, one should definitely have a good qualitative and quantitative understanding of the laser dynamics, because this is essential for finding appropriate parameter values (e.g. concerning the chosen laser crystal, the mode size in the crystal, the resonator length, etc.).
For Q-switched <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> (not for <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>), it is often sufficient (at least for rough estimates) to use some relatively simple equations, which might even be solved on a pocket calculator.
More sophisticated <a href="fiberpower_qs_yag_bp.html">numerical models</a> are required if certain additional effects are of interest, such as <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">gain guiding</a> (which might strongly affect the obtained beam diameter) or a limited speed of the Q-switch.</p>
