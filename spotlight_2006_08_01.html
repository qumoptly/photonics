<p>Abstract: Quantum theory as well semiclassical theories describe the noise of a laser to be influenced by vacuum fluctuations (zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field) which intrude the laser resonator e.g. via the output coupler. Such theories may appear strange, but allow to accurately and relatively simply calculate the noise properties of various kinds of devices such as lasers, laser amplifiers, optical parametric oscillators and amplifiers, and frequency doublers. The article gives some idea of how this works.</p>

<p>Lasers are known to be rather sensitive devices.
However, most people will be surprised to learn that even <i>nothing</i> &ndash; the vacuum! &ndash; introduces noise into lasers.</p>
<p>This is no joke, but rather a crucial element of a <a href="quantum_optics.html" title="the part of optics which deals with quantum effects">quantum-optical</a> description of <a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a>, and also in semiclassical theories as developed e.g. by researchers at the Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure in Paris in the 1980s (see the reference above).
In this picture, noise is introduced into the optical field circulating in a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> not only by pump fluctuations and alike, but also results from the zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, which leak into the laser resonator.
This happens particularly at the <a href="output_couplers.html" title="partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupler</a> mirror, but also at any other location where optical losses occur.
(There is no way to let radiation disappear without opening a path for quantum fluctuations coming in.)
These &ldquo;vacuum fluctuations&rdquo; thus affect the intracavity field, and interestingly they again mix with it in the laser output: the output field is described as a superposition of the intracavity field partly leaking out of the resonator and the vacuum fluctuations coming from outside the resonator and being partly reflected at the output coupler.
How these two fields are correlated with each other depends on the optical frequency.
Somewhat aside from a cavity resonance there are phase shifts associated with off-resonant excitation.
For frequency further away from the resonance (i.e., for large noise frequencies), one obtains little intensity coming from inside the resonator, and the output is dominated by the reflected vacuum fluctuations, which turn out to be responsible for the <a href="shot_noise.html" title="quantum-limited intensity noise">shot noise</a> observed at these frequencies.</p>
<p>Skeptical readers may find it disturbing that one cannot test such claims by blocking the &ldquo;vacuum input&rdquo; and checking the difference in outcome: even a totally absorbing medium will remove any incident <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>, but can not kill the vacuum fluctuations.
However, the mentioned theories are experimentally well tested, surely accurate, and particularly their semiclassical forms are very convenient tools to calculate the noise properties of all sorts of devices &ndash; not only lasers, but also <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">laser amplifiers</a> as well as parametric devices such as <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillators</a> and <a href="optical_parametric_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on parametric nonlinear interactions">parametric amplifiers</a>, and <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doublers</a>.</p>

<h2>Business Disputes</h2>
<p>Occasionally, serious disputes arise, e.g. when a company purchases a laser from some supplier. Conflicting views may occur concerning questions as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the <a href="./beam_quality.html?banner=arbitration">beam quality</a> consistent with the somewhat vague specifications?</li>
<li>Is it normal that the laser pulses exhibit substantial <a href="./timing_jitter.html?banner=arbitration">timing jitter</a>?</li>
<li>Should it be considered as acceptable that the laser stays within specifications only if its alignment is optimized quite often by the user?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mediation</h3>
<p>Going to court is usually the last thing you want to do &ndash; but how else to resolve a conflict?</p>
<p>Mediation is a much more attractive approach. Only, you need to find a mediator</p>
<ul>
<li>who fully understands the technical matters, and</li>
<li>who can be trusted to be impartial and fair.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./paschotta.html?banner=arbitration">Dr. Paschotta</a> from RP Photonics offers such services. Your chance is to reach a fair resolution with far less time and money than at court.</p>
