<p>We don't know it from experience in our everyday life, but still believe it: the superposition of two light beams with equal intensities, equal frequencies and a proper relative phase shift can result in zero optical intensity.
We call this <em>destructive interference</em>, and one may describe this with the equation &ldquo;light + light = darkness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Checking the energy balance, one may at first be a bit irritated: light comes in through two beams, carrying some optical power, and no light comes out.
So does energy of the light beams disappear?
Well, we tend to strongly believe in energy conservation, but how to resolve this puzzle?</p>
<p>The key is to look at concrete situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>One may superimpose two light beams (e.g. <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>) e.g. on a screen, with the two beams coming from slightly different angles.
We then get an interference pattern, with zero intensity in the dark fringes, but four times the intensity of a single beam in the bright fringes.
(Why four times, not two times? Because the amplitude is doubled, resulting in four times the intensity.)
The overall power on the screen (i.e., the spatially integrated total intensity) is then just the sum of the powers of the two beams.
The period of the fringe pattern depends on the angle between the beams, and one can show via a simple calculation that when the incoming beams did originally not overlap, the relative phase will vary so much on the screen that you get at least a dark and a bright fringe, not e.g. darkness everywhere on the screen.</li>
<li>To avoid the spatial variation of relative phase, we need to have collinear beams.
But how to superimpose them in such a way, if they originally have an angle of e.g. 90&deg; between them?
Use some <a href="beam_splitters.html" title="devices for splitting a laser beam into two or more beams">beam splitter</a>, for example, i.e. a partially transmissive <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirror</a>, oriented at 45&deg; to the input beams.
You will see then that you get two outputs, not just one.
By properly adjusting the relative phase of the input beams, you can get complete darkness in one of the outputs (assuming equal intensity patterns and powers of both beams).
Then, however, all the power goes into the other output: you get constructive interference there.
By the way, it is instructive to consider which restrictions on the phase of transmitted and reflected beams any beam splitter has to obey in order to guarantee energy conservation, and to check how real beam splitters do that.
Consider e.g. the Fresnel reflection on a glass/air interface, and you will see that the additional &pi; phase shift for a beam coming from inside the glass is essential.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, that's all classical <a href="wave_optics.html" title="the description of optical phenomena based on wave models">wave optics</a>, and once you have swallowed that light behaves like waves, you will no longer find destructive interference so puzzling.
Things get really weird, however, in experiments with single <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>.
Consider an <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometer</a>, set up for destructive interference in one output port, and a single photon being sent into the device.
One might think that destructive interference can not happen in that case, since the photon can go only through one of the two interferometer ports, but experiments tell the opposite.
That shows quite clearly that photons should not be naively identified with wave packets.
(Also don't do that with electrons or atoms, please!)
To calculate what happens, we always have to assume that a beam splitter sends some wave stuff into each output, even when it receives a single photon only.
This holds, even though we have never seen half a photon in a light beam (or half an electron, if you use those).
There is a significant number of interesting <a href="quantum_optics.html" title="the part of optics which deals with quantum effects">quantum optics</a> experiments in that area, and Google presents you with interesting reading when fed e.g. with &ldquo;single photon interferometer&rdquo;.
Such experiments often involve photon pairs, and quantum entanglement is often essential to understand them.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="./spotlight_2009_10_19.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
