<p>Optically pumping some medium essentially means to inject <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> in order to electronically excite the medium or some of its constituents into other (usually higher-lying) energy levels.
In the context of <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> or laser <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a>, the goal is to achieve a <a href="population_inversion.html" title="a state of a medium where a higher-lying electronic level has a higher population than a lower-lying level">population inversion</a> in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> and thus to obtain optical amplification via <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a> for some range of <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequencies</a>.
(The width of that range is called the <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier"><em>gain bandwidth</em></a>.)
In other cases, such as in <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopic</a> measurements, the goal can be to selectively populate a specific electronic level (e.g. some hyperfine sublevel), which does not necessarily have an energy well above the ground state.</p>
<p>Optical pumping processes can often be described with <a href="rate_equation_modeling.html" title="a method of modeling the dynamics of laser gain media">rate equation modeling</a>.
However, this disregards some aspects of the quantum nature of the atom&ndash;photon interaction.
More comprehensive physical models exist which can also describe coherent phenomena such as <a href="rabi_oscillations.html" title="oscillations of level populations (or quantum mechanical probability amplitudes) under the influence of an incident light field">Rabi oscillations</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optically Pumped Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>Various types of <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> can be optically pumped:</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:236px;">
<img src="img/nd_pumping.png" alt="pumping of neodymium laser ions">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Neodymium ions (e.g. in a <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">YAG laser</a>) can be optically pumped to some high-lying energy levels, from where they quickly decay (green arrow) into the upper laser level, from where stimulated emission at the laser <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> of 1064&nbsp;nm (for example) can occur.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>The most common optically pumped lasers are doped-insulator <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>.
As the host medium (a <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>, <a href="laser_crystals_versus_glasses.html">glass</a> or <a href="ceramic_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which have a ceramic (polycrystalline) microscopic structure">piece of ceramic</a>) is electrically insulating, optical pumping is the only way to supply the laser-active ions (e.g. <a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">rare earth ions</a>) with energy.
See Figure&nbsp;1 as an example.</li>
<li><a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">Semiconductor lasers</a> are in most cases electrically pumped, but optical pumping can have certain advantages.
In the case of <a href="vertical_external_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="surface-emitting semiconductor lasers with an external laser resonator">vertical external cavity surface-emitting lasers</a> (VECSELs) it allows for a laser output with very high <a href="brightness.html" title="a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: often used instead of radiance or luminance">brightness</a> (high power combined with high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>).
In other cases, optical pumping is sometimes used for testing purposes, e.g. when new semiconductor compositions are investigated.
Optically pumped semiconductor gain media generally have a simpler structure than their electrically pumped cousins.</li>
<li>In rare cases, <a href="gas_lasers.html" title="lasers with a gas (or plasma) as gain medium">gas lasers</a> (particularly alkali vapor lasers) are optically pumped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common types of optical pump sources are:</p>
<ul>
<li>discharge lamps (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps"><em>lamp-pumped lasers</em></a>)</li>
<li><a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes"><em>diode-pumped lasers</em></a>)</li>
<li>other types of lasers or laser sources</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of the latter case are <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers</a> pumped with <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency-doubled</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>, and <a href="dye_lasers.html" title="lasers based on liquid or solid dyes as gain media">dye lasers</a> pumped with <a href="gas_lasers.html" title="lasers with a gas (or plasma) as gain medium">gas lasers</a>.</p>
<p>A requirement for achieving a high <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">power conversion efficiency</a> in an optically pumped laser is that the pump light is efficiently absorbed in the gain medium.
This can be the case if the gain medium is sufficiently long, has a high <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a>, and a sufficiently wide optical frequency range for the pump light.
In some cases, the <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> efficiency can be increased by arranging for multiple passes of the pump light through the gain medium.
This technique is often used e.g. in <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a>.</p>
<p>A frequently used alternative to optical pumping is electrical pumping, applied particularly to <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> and <a href="gas_lasers.html" title="lasers with a gas (or plasma) as gain medium">gas lasers</a>.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Using Multiple Electronic Levels</h3>
<div>
<p>In the simplest case, the optically pumped medium absorbs light, and each absorbed <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> excites one atom or ion into a higher-lying electronic level.
The energy difference of the involved electronic levels must match the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon energy</a> of the pump light.
Once some degree of excitation of the medium has been achieved, the same kind of light can also cause <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a>, bringing excited atoms or ions back to the lower level.
For that reason, a medium with a simple two-level scheme cannot reach a <a href="population_inversion.html" title="a state of a medium where a higher-lying electronic level has a higher population than a lower-lying level">population inversion</a>.</p>
<p>Optical pumping in lasers involves at least three different energy levels.
In the simplest case, laser-active ions are pumped from their ground state to a higher-lying level, from where they undergo a quick radiative or <a href="non_radiative_transitions.html" title="transitions between energy levels of atoms or ions which are not associated with the emission of light">non-radiative</a> decay into an excited level with somewhat lower energy.
As pump light cannot cause stimulated emission from this level down to the ground state (due to the too high photon energy), a population inversion can be achieved for a sufficiently high pump intensity.
By introducing a fourth energy level, one can obtain a four-level laser system, where the <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transition</a> involves two intermediate levels.
If the lower level population is kept small due to a quick decay to the ground state, population inversion can be achieved even when only a tiny fraction of the ions is excited.
The article on <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">four-level and three-level gain media</a> explains the details.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">In-band Pumping</h3>
<div>
<p>Solid state laser gain media often exhibit slightly non-degenerate Stark level manifolds.
Due to the energy variations within each manifold, optically pumped laser operation is possible even with only two involved manifolds: ions are pumped from the lower manifold (usually the ground-state manifold) to some higher manifold, and the laser transition directly leads from there back to the lower manifold, with no intermediate manifolds.</p>
<p>This pump scheme, called <em>in-band pumping</em>, can be used with various laser-active ions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">Ytterbium-doped gain media</a> exhibit only two Stark level manifolds, so there is no other option than in-band pumping.</li>
<li><a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media doped with erbium ions">Erbium-doped gain media</a> can be in-band-pumped, using the lowest two levels (<sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub> and <sup>4</sup>I<sub>13/2</sub>).
This means that e.g. an <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifier</a> is <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">pumped</a> around 1450&nbsp;nm while amplifying around 1550&nbsp;nm.
Similarly, there are Er:<a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">YAG lasers</a> which are pumped with an erbium-doped fiber laser or amplifier, and emitting at 1645&nbsp;nm.</li>
<li>The same scheme can also be applied e.g. to thulium-doped media.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term <em>in-band pumping</em> is also often used in cases where the laser-active ions are pumped from the ground-state manifold (not being the lower laser level) directly into the upper laser level.
For example, this happens when a <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium-doped</a> <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> is pumped around 0.88&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
<p>In-band pumping often leads to a small <a href="quantum_defect.html" title="energy difference between pump and laser photons">quantum defect</a>, but also often to significant effects of reabsorption from the lower laser level (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level"><em>quasi-three level behavior</em></a>).
Also, the achievable degree of excitation (and thus the laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>) can be limited by <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a> caused by the pump light.
A somewhat shorter pump wavelength may mitigate the latter problem, but this can decrease the pump absorption efficiency.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Side Pumping Versus End Pumping</h3>
<div>
<p>In an optically pumped laser, pump light can be injected into the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> from different directions.
<a href="side_pumping.html" title="a technique of pumping a solid-state laser in directions which are approximately transverse to its beam direction">Side pumping</a> means that the light is injected in directions which are roughly perpendicular to that of the <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>.
In the case of <a href="end_pumping.html" title="a technique of optically pumping a laser medium in a direction along the laser beam">end pumping</a>, the pump light is approximately collinear with the laser beam.
The pump geometry has implications for the required beam quality (see below), but also the achieved power conversion efficiency, the laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, and the laser <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Requirements on the Pump Light</h3>
<div>
<p>Pump light for optical pumping has to fulfill a number of requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> of the pump light must be suitable.
Ideally, all the <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a> should have a suitable energy for the wanted electronic transitions.
However, certain laser-active ions (e.g. <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium</a> ions) can also be pumped with fairly broadband light e.g. for <a href="flash_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps which are used for generating intense light pulses">flash lamps</a> or <a href="arc_lamps.html" title="gas discharge lamps based on an electrical arc, or continuously operating gas discharge lamps">arc lamps</a>, albeit with a strongly reduced power conversion efficiency.</li>
<li>The pump intensity must be sufficiently high.
Lasers are often pumped with intensities of the order of the <a href="saturation_power.html" title="a measure of the incident optical power required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation intensity</a> of the laser transition, but four-level lasers can also be operated with lower pump intensities.</li>
<li>Depending on the geometry, there can be more or less stringent requirements on the pump <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
This applies mostly to <a href="end_pumping.html" title="a technique of optically pumping a laser medium in a direction along the laser beam">end-pumped lasers</a>.</li>
<li>In some cases, the polarization state of the pump light is also important.
Some non-isotropic gain media, such as <a href="vanadate_lasers.html" title="lasers based on rare-earth-doped yttrium, gadolinium or lutetium vanadate crystals, usually Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>">Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub></a>, exhibit very different levels of absorption for different polarization directions.
In <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a>, circularly polarized light is sometimes required for populating certain hyperfine levels.</li>
<li>The <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a> of the pump source should not be too large, because at least its low-frequency components can be transferred to the laser output.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Pumping in Fundamental Physics</h2>
<div>
<p>Techniques of optical pumping are also used outside the area of <a href="laser_physics.html" title="the field of physics dealing with phenomena in lasers">laser physics</a>, often in fundamental research.
For example, various methods of <a href="laser_cooling.html" title="a variety of techniques for reducing the temperature (i.e., the random motion) of small particles such as atoms or ions">laser cooling</a> essentially depend on optical pumping of atoms or ions, for example suspended in an optical trap.
In many cases, certain selection rules play a vital role, which reflect principles like the conservation of angular momentum: the absorption of <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a> of circularly polarized light must accordingly change the angular momentum of the atoms, i.e., it must lead to final states having correspondingly modified angular momentum.
Therefore, it is possible, for example, to selectively pump certain states within a manifold of states having essentially the same excitation energy.
In many cases, such processes involve multiple steps of optical pumping and <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> until the final target states are largely populated.</p>
<p>Interestingly, optical pumping can reduce the entropy of atoms or ions; such processes are associated with an increase of entropy of the light field, such that the total entropy is never decreased and in fact often increased.</p>
<p>Optical pumping can also be utilized for isotope separation, because different isotopes of a substance exhibit slightly different transition energies.</p>
