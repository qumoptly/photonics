<p>For applications in microelectronics, an extremely powerful technology platform based on silicon chips has been developed in the recent decades.
This is now the basis of complex microprocessors, large memory circuits, and other digital and analog electronics.
With the introduction of the silicon-on-insulator technology [3] it has been demonstrated that <a href="photonics.html" title="the science and technology of light">photonic</a> functions can be integrated into this technology platform, so that silicon-based <a href="photonic_integrated_circuits.html" title="integrated circuits with optical functions"><em>photonic integrated circuits</em></a> became possible.
Here, different kinds of optical components can be connected with each other using silicon <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a> [1].
Such circuits could be used e.g. to establish very fast communication between circuit boards, between chips on a board, or even within single chips, e.g. connecting different cores of a microprocessor.
There is a strong need for such fast communication links, because the rapid progress of microprocessors may soon be severely limited by the transmission bandwidth capabilities of electronic connections, made e.g. of copper.
<a href="optical_data_transmission.html" title="the transmission of information using light beams, e.g. in fibers">Optical data transmission</a> allows for much higher data rates and would at the same time eliminate problems resulting from electromagnetic interference.
The technology may also be useful for other areas of <a href="optical_data_transmission.html" title="the transmission of information using light beams, e.g. in fibers">optical communications</a>, such as <a href="fiber_to_the_home.html" title="the technology of providing data connections to private homes via optical fibers rather than electric cables">fiber to the home</a>.</p>
<p>Silicon photonics can also be considered from the viewpoint of <a href="photonics.html" title="the science and technology of light">photonics</a>, which is so far normally based on other <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">optical materials</a>.
(<em>Silica</em> = amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> is common in photonics, e.g. in <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>, but not elementary silicon.)
The implementation of silicon-based photonic devices, maybe even electrically pumped silicon lasers and silicon amplifiers, could possibly lead to much smaller and much cheaper photonic devices, making accessible a range of applications which so far have been impossible already for reasons of too high cost.</p>
<p>It is clear that an enormous amount of work, corresponding to huge capital investments, is still required before silicon photonics can be established as a key technology.
However, the potential merits motivate big players such as Intel to pursue this development seriously.
If it is successful, it can lead to a very powerful technology with huge benefits for photonics and microelectronics and their applications.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Technological Challenges</h2>
<div>
<p>Although the possible merits of silicon-based photonics are huge, there are also very substantial challenges for such a technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having an indirect <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap</a>, silicon is a very inefficient light emitter.
Although various tricks have been developed to get around this, the <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> or <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a> performance of silicon-based devices cannot compete with that for other approaches, based on, e.g., gallium arsenide or indium phosphide.</li>
<li>The band gap of silicon is also larger than desirable, making it impossible to detect light in the telecom spectral regions around 1.5 and 1.3&nbsp;&mu;m.</li>
<li>Silicon has no <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&chi;</span><sup>(2)</sup></span> nonlinearity, making it impossible to realize <a href="electro_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic modulators</a> with this material.</li>
<li>The heat dissipated by a laser source on a chip might well be more than is convenient.</li>
<li>Optical connections often require very precise alignment, which demands improved alignment technologies for efficient mass production.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to fabricate <em>hybrid devices</em> where the photonic functions are provided by structures made of III&ndash;V semiconductors (with a direct band gap of suitable width and electro-optic properties), such as indium phosphide, and these are placed on a silicon chip containing the bulk of the electronic components.
One class of techniques is based on epitaxial regrowth procedures, which are complicated and often greatly reduce the yield.
Another approach is to apply a sophisticated bonding process to combine a silicon chip containing waveguides with an indium phosphide chip providing the optical gain [17].
Here, precise alignment between the two chips is required.
Both technical approaches, leading to silicon hybrid devices, tend to be expensive and are strongly limited in complexity.
Therefore, all-silicon solutions, arising from the &ldquo;siliconization of photonics&rdquo;, would be more suitable for widespread application.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">State of Research</h2>
<div>
<p>The following paragraphs briefly describe the current state of research concerning basic building blocks of silicon photonics:</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Guiding Light</h3>
<div>
<p>For guiding light in <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a>, silicon is suitable [1,&thinsp;2].
There are e.g. rib waveguides with oxide cladding, exhibiting <a href="propagation_losses.html" title="losses of optical energy during propagation of light">propagation losses</a> of well below 1&nbsp;dB/cm.
The transparency range of silicon extends from &asymp;&thinsp;1.1&nbsp;&mu;m to the far-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> region.
The tight mode confinement allows sharp bends without excessive <a href="bend_losses.html" title="propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">bend losses</a>.
It also enables the use of <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> for certain functions, e.g. <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplification</a> via <a href="four_wave_mixing.html" title="an interaction of light waves based on a &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity">four-wave mixing</a>.
Efficient coupling to <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>, having much larger <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode areas</a>, is possible with nanotapers [7].</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Laser Sources</h3>
<div>
<p>For <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> light sources and for <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a>, the indirect band gap of silicon is hardly usable.
Some progress has been achieved with porous silicon and with silicon nanoparticles in silica, but the performance achieved can not compete with that of e.g. indium-phosphide-based devices.</p>
<p>On the other hand, silicon allows for efficient <a href="raman_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on Raman gain">Raman amplification</a>, because the <a href="raman_gain.html" title="optical gain arising from stimulated Raman scattering">Raman gain</a> coefficient of silicon is very high and the waveguides confine the mode to a very small area.
Although a <a href="raman_lasers.html" title="lasers based on Raman gain rather than on laser gain from stimulated emission">Raman laser</a> [8,&thinsp;18,&thinsp;22] or <a href="raman_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on Raman gain">amplifier</a> [21] still requires an <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">optical pump</a> source, it can be useful for accessing longer wavelength regions, and possibly even to generate multiple wavelengths [22].</p>
<p>Another approach is to provide the active function in a III&ndash;V semiconductor material (see above), which is bonded to a silicon waveguide structure; the evanescent field of the silicon waveguide can then be strong enough for efficient amplification [17].
Also, it is possible to fabricate monolithic structures with germanium grown directly on silicon (<em>Ge-on-Si technology</em>), where doped germanium serves as the laser material [25].</p>
<p>If the realization of a laser source on a silicon chip is not feasible, one may use an external <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled laser diode</a> and couple the light to the silicon chip with a single-mode fiber, using a nanotaper [7].</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Modulation of Light</h3>
<div>
<p>Silicon-based <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulators</a> can be realized with Mach&ndash;Zehnder <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a> and phase modulation via a change in carrier density [12]: injecting carriers with an electrode changes the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> in one arm of the interferometer, which translates the phase change into a change in power transmission.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to use a micro-ring <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">resonator</a> [19,&thinsp;24].
Transmission bandwidths of multiple gigabits per second can be achieved with such devices.</p>
<p>Very compact and energy-efficient devices can also be realized as <a href="electroabsorption_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the Franz&ndash;Keldysh effect">electroabsorption modulators</a> made with epitaxial germanium on silicon [23].</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Photodetection</h3>
<div>
<p>A silicon <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> (<a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a>) is normally sensitive only for light with wavelengths below 1.1&nbsp;&mu;m, corresponding to the band gap.
Photodetectors for telecommunication wavelengths around 1.5 or 1.3&nbsp;&mu;m are possible with silicon&ndash;germanium alloys (SiGe) [13].
Problems arise from the resulting lattice mismatch, which leads to crystal defects.</p>
<p>A new kind of silicon-based photodetector is the <em>plasmonic internal-photoemission detector</em> (PIPED).
It is based on plasmonic effects at a metal&ndash;semiconductor&ndash;metal (MSM) interface, which forms an optical <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>: light is absorbed in a metal barrier, generates surface plasmon polaritons (SPP); those generate &ldquo;hot electrons&rdquo; in the metal, which then can tunnel through the semiconductor barrier when a voltage is applied between the electrodes.
Such photodetectors can be made very small and can have a very high detection <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> for light e.g. at 1550&nbsp;nm wavelength [28].</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Terahertz Silicon Photonics</h3>
<div>
<p>Silicon technology can not only be used for working with light, but also with <a href="terahertz_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation with frequencies around 0.1 THz to 10 THz">terahertz radiation</a>.
For example, one can realize plasmonic internal-photoemission detectors (PIPEDs) on the silicon photonics platform, which can be used as <a href="terahertz_detectors.html" title="detectors for terahertz radiation">terahertz detectors</a> [29].</p>

<h2>Free Tutorial: Modeling of Fiber Amplifiers and Lasers</h2>
<p>We have published a new <a href="./tutorial_modeling.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">tutorial</a> which discusses the modeling of fiber amplifiers and lasers.
It addresses many questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a <a href="./tutorial_modeling1.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">model</a>?</li>
<li>Should one use <a href="./tutorial_modeling3.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">power propagation or field propagation</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate the behavior of <a href="./tutorial_modeling4.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">laser-active ions</a>?</li>
<li>How to calculate <a href="./tutorial_modeling5.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">steady-state solutions</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate <a href="./tutorial_modeling6.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">dynamical behavior</a> and <a href="./tutorial_modeling7.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">ultrashort pulse propagation</a>?</li>
<li>What aspects are important for the <a href="./tutorial_modeling8.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">decision</a> whether to develop own modeling software or use commercial software?</li>
