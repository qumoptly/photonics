</header>
<p>Optics has been started many centuries ago as the science dealing with the properties of <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> &ndash; a part of the discipline of physics.
It also became more and more important for practical applications and can therefore now also be regarded as an important field of technology.
As the properties of light have already been known quite precisely for several decades, most of current optics research focuses on applications.
For example, one can study technical optics, which focuses on the operation principles and further optimization of various optical components and devices.</p>
<p>Optics plays a crucial role in the area of <a href="photonics.html" title="the science and technology of light">photonics</a>, mainly concerning various properties of light and on its propagation e.g. through transparent <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">optical materials</a>.
It also has a very substantial economical importance as an enabler for many other modern technologies.
However, many details of the generation and detection of light lie outside the field of optics, which deals mainly with the propagation of light.
Photonics contains other important fields like <a href="laser_physics.html" title="the field of physics dealing with phenomena in lasers">laser physics</a> which interface with optical physics.</p>
<p>Nowadays, optics deals not only with visible light, but also with <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> and <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>, as these have many properties in common with visible light, and are often utilized with similar optical components.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Classical Optics</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Geometrical Optics</h3>
<div>
<p>To some extent, the propagation of light can be described with <em>ray optics</em> or <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light"><em>geometrical optics</em></a>, where light is considered to consist of rays which propagate along straight lines, at least in homogeneous optical media.
The effects of optical components on light rays is often described with an <a href="abcd_matrix.html" title="a 2-by-2 matrix describing the effect of an optical element on a laser beam">ABCD matrix</a> algorithm.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/rays_at_curved_mirror.png" alt="light rays reflected at a spherically curved mirror">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Reflection of light rays at a spherically curved mirror.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Although geometrical optics has serious limitations &ndash; it cannot describe various important physical phenomena involving <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> or <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a>, for example &ndash; it is still useful.
For example, many properties of <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">optical imaging</a> systems containing <a href="mirrors.html" title="devices which reflect light">mirrors</a>, <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>, <a href="prisms.html" title="transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prisms</a> etc. can be well understood with geometrical optics, although their performance limitations can not be completely explained with ray optics.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Physical Optics, Wave Optics</h3>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:400px;">
<img src="img/fiberpower_launch_mm.gif" alt="intensity profiles at the end of a multimode fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Intensity profiles at the end of a <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fiber</a> for a variable input beam position, shown as animated graphics. Such calculations need to be based on wave optics; ray optics are not sufficient. The image is from a <a href="fiberpower_launch.html">case study</a> with the software <a href="fiberpower.html">RP Fiber Power</a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some physical phenomena show quite clearly that light has properties of waves, although the rather short <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> of light do not always make that obvious.
However, <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> and <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> processes in particular are hard to explain without optical waves.
Around 1865, James Clerk Maxwell managed to demonstrate that light can indeed be identified with transverse electromagnetic waves of <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">frequencies</a> of the order of hundreds of terahertz.
This quickly explained many phenomena e.g. in the context of <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> and <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a>.
Some of the first practical results were explanations for the limited optical performance e.g. of <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscopes</a> and <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescopes</a>, and hints towards further optimization of their performance.</p>
<p>Light propagation in optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> can also be well described only with ray optics; see Figure&nbsp;2 for an example.</p>
<p>Beyond an improved understanding, many new kinds of devices and operation principles have resulted from the evolution of physical optics and <a href="wave_optics.html" title="the description of optical phenomena based on wave models">wave optics</a>.
For example, powerful <a href="spectrometers.html" title="devices for separating spectral components">spectrometers</a> based on <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a> have been realized, <a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">dielectric coatings</a> (thin-film coatings) have become very important in various fields of photonics, and <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonators</a> play important roles e.g. as <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filters</a> and as <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonators</a>.</p>
<p>Large parts of physical optics require quite sophisticated and partly abstract mathematical methods, although greatly simplified mathematical methods are still sufficient for many purposes.
Numerical computation methods have become very important, greatly simplifying the work in many cases.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Quantum Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Although the description of light as classical electromagnetic waves, as developed in the 19th century, has been extremely successful, it became apparent in the early 20th century that there are phenomena which are hard to explain on that basis.
For example, Albert Einstein realized that the <a href="photoelectric_effect.html" title="the emission or excitation of electric carriers related to the absorption of light">photoelectric effect</a> seemed to suggest that light energy is not delivered continuously, but in certain discrete packages, which are nowadays called <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>.
The further development of quantum mechanics led to a physical description which reconciles quite well the wave nature and apparent particle properties of light, although the resulting physical model is hard to bring together with intuitive ideas, and some aspects of quantum physics are still a matter of debate, essentially concerning interpretations.
Note, however, that there seem to be no logical flaws or gaps of understanding in the sense that phenomena could not be properly described or predicted.</p>
<p>The field of optics which is specifically dealing with quantum effects is called <a href="quantum_optics.html" title="the part of optics which deals with quantum effects"><em>quantum optics</em></a>.
In recent years, quantum optics has led to interesting technological developments; important keywords are <a href="quantum_cryptography.html" title="methods to encrypt information securely, relying on quantum-mechanical phenomena">quantum cryptography</a> (for secure data transmission based on physical principles) and quantum computing.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Technical Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Technical optics is based on optical physics, but focuses on optical components and systems for transforming and utilizing light, not on studying the properties of light itself.
Some examples for areas of activity and technical optics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modeling and design methods for developing optical systems are still being further refined and optimized.
While in the early times sophisticated mathematical methods were defined, numerical computational methods have become more and more important.
Partly, they are based on previously developed mathematical methods, and partly they replace analytical methods with numerical approaches, which are sometimes substantially more practical.</li>
<li><a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">Optical materials</a> and their <a href="optical_fabrication.html" title="the fabrication of optical components like lenses, prisms and mirrors">fabrication</a> are further optimized, and occasionally new materials are developed.</li>
<li>Various optical components and devices are also developed further, and new concepts are introduced.
Some progress in optical technology is based on new materials or improve fabrication technologies, which can be utilized e.g. for improving the performance of optical systems or making them simpler, more compact and less expensive.
For example, new fabrication techniques for <a href="aspheric_optics.html" title="optical elements with non-spherical surfaces">aspheric optics</a> and high-quality <a href="plastic_optics.html" title="optical elements made of organic polymer materials">plastic optics</a> allow one to realize extremely compact <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photo cameras</a> with astonishing performance figures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of technical optics is based on classical optics, i.e., not involving quantum effects.</p>
<p>Modern optics deals with light propagation not only in &ldquo;simple&rdquo; artificial media, but also for example in the atmosphere (<em>atmospheric optics</em>) and in strongly <a href="scattering.html" title="processes where light is sent in other directions, usually but not always in random directions">scattering</a> biological materials.</p>
