<h2 class="togglediv">Part 6: Fiber Joints</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Types of Fiber Joints</h3>
<div>
<p>Optical fibers can be joined together, such that light is efficiently transferred from one fiber to another.
There are various possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mechanical_fiber_splices.html" title="permanent or semi-permanent connections of optical fibers which are held in place with mechanical means">Mechanical splicing</a> means that two fiber ends are tightly hold together with some mechanical means.
That is usually done for permanent connections, but it may be possible to dismantle a splice without spoiling the fiber ends.</li>
<li>Another technique is <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicing</a>, where the fibers are fused together, e.g. using an electrical arc.
This leads to particularly low <a href="insertion_loss.html" title="power losses due to insertion of a device">insertion loss</a> and high <a href="return_loss.html" title="a measure for how much reflected light is attenuated">return loss</a>, if the two fiber cores are similar.</li>
<li>For non-permanent connections, one can also use <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a> (see below).</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Coupling Losses of Imperfect Fiber Joints</h3>
<div>
<p>A frequently asked question is how large will be coupling losses e.g. at a mechanical splice, when there is some kind of imperfection, for example</p>
<ul>
<li>a parallel offset of the fiber cores,</li>
<li class="ta_left">a deviation between the fiber axis directions,</li>
<li class="ta_left ta_left">a mismatch of core sizes, or</li>
<li class="ta_left ta_left ta_left">an air gap between the fiber ends.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that some of the answers are quite different for single-mode and multimode fibers.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Single-mode Fibers</h3>
<div>
<p>It is relatively easy to calculate coupling losses for single-mode fibers.
Essentially, the guided mode from the first fiber (the input) creates some amplitude profile in the second fiber, which may be somewhat displaced, for example, due to an imperfect splice.
One can now calculate the coupling efficiency as an overlap integral between that amplitude profile and that of the guided mode of the second fiber.
(Numerical beam propagation is not required.)</p>
<p>For the case of Gaussian mode profiles with different mode radii and some parallel offset, one can use the equation which we already discussed in <a href="passive_fiber_optics3.html">part 3</a>:</p>
<aside class="callout red">Caution: For non-Gaussian mode profiles, you need more refined tools for calculating coupling losses &ndash; for example, the <a href="rp_fiber_calculator.html"><b>RP Fiber Calculator PRO</b></a> software.</aside>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/eta_wdx.gif" width="221" height="62" alt="coupling efficiency for single-mode fibers"></div>
<p>A similar equation can be used for an angular mismatch:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/eta_theta.gif" width="160" height="56" alt="coupling efficiency for single-mode fibers with angular misalignment"></div>
<p>This shows that the angular alignment is more critical for single-mode fibers with <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area</a>.
For standard mode areas, the angular alignment is usually easier to achieve than the position alignment.</p>
<p>The following figures are based on the equations above.</p>
<figure>

This has been calculated for different ratios of the mode radius to the wavelength.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Concerning <a href="cleaving_of_fibers.html" title="preparing fiber ends with clean optical surfaces by controlled breaking">angle-cleaved fiber ends</a>, it is often of interest how large the cleave angle needs to be to avoid significant reflection into the core mode.
The equation can well be used for that; one simply has to keep in mind that the angular deviation of the reflected beam is <em>twice</em> the cleave angle.
As an example, a fiber with a standard mode area of 100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>, having <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i></span> = 5.64&nbsp;&mu;m, needs a cleave angle of at least 7.4&deg; in order to have a backreflection below 10<sup>&minus;4</sup>, i.e., at least 40&nbsp;dB <a href="return_loss.html" title="a measure for how much reflected light is attenuated">return loss</a>, at 1.5&nbsp;&mu;m wavelength.
For a <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fiber</a> with 1000&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>, 2.3&deg; would be sufficient.
Note that longer wavelengths require larger cleave angles, as they lead to large beam divergence.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Caution: equations for Gaussian mode profile may give inaccurate results!</aside>
<p>Note, however, that the above equations are valid only for modes with Gaussian profiles.
In the regime of high suppression of the back-reflection from an angled fiber end, however, the results are sensitive to deviations from a Gaussian mode profile.
There, one has to numerically calculate the back-reflection, e.g. with our <a href="rp_fiber_calculator.html"><b>RP Fiber Calculator PRO</b></a> software, based on calculated mode profiles.</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider some more details.
For example, does it matter for the losses from which fiber the input light comes, if the mode sizes are different?
According to the equation above, it doesn't.
This is true, although it might be surprising: one could imagine that going from a smaller core to a larger one causes lower losses than in the other direction.
Note, however, that the smaller mode has a larger <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, i.e., a wider field distribution in spatial Fourier space, and that is too much for the other fiber with larger mode.
So the fraction of power lost at the splice really doesn't depend on the direction; only the lost light is differently distributed over the <a href="cladding_modes.html" title="modes in optical fibers (or other waveguides) which are not restricted to the region around the core">cladding modes</a>.</p>
<p>One could imagine that when going from a smaller-mode fiber to one with a larger mode, one could avoid the coupling losses if the second fiber has the same NA despite the larger core.
(It might still be single-mode if the <a href="v_number.html" title="a normalized frequency parameter, which determines the number of modes of a step-index fiber">V number</a> is low enough.)
After all, the angular range should be limited only by the NA.
However, this expectation is wrong; a mismatch of mode sizes inevitably causes coupling losses, if both fibers are single-mode.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Multimode Fibers</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Our <a href="rp_fiber_calculator.html"><b>RP Fiber Calculator PRO</b></a> software can tell you the coupling losses for each input mode, calculated using the mode functions.</aside>
<p>For <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, the losses cannot be specified as a single number: they are generally mode-dependent.
This means that for arbitrary input light fields, the resulting overall loss will depend on how the power is distributed over the modes.
One can imagine, for example, that light is launched into low-order modes only with a laser, and that this leads to low splice losses.
If one then strongly bends the fiber before the splice, the light might be redistributed into higher-order modes, and the splice losses get larger.</p>
<p>As an example for coupling losses, consider a perfect mechanical splice between two step-index multimode fibers with equal NA of 0.2 (calculated from the maximum index difference), but the first fiber has a core diameter of 62.5&nbsp;&mu;m and the second one only 50&nbsp;&mu;m.
We can calculate each mode of the first fiber, sum up the modulus squared of its overlap integral with all modes of the second fiber, and in that way obtain its coupling loss.
(Alternatively, one may use a numerically simulated beam propagation, but this takes more computation time and is tentatively less precise.)
Figure&nbsp;2 shows the losses versus the <span class="eqn_il"><i>m</i></span> value of the modes.
These losses are highest for low <span class="eqn_il"><i>m</i></span> but high <span class="eqn_il"><i>l</i></span> values.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/mm_fiber_splice1.png" alt="losses at multimode fiber splice">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;5:</span> 
Mode-dependent coupling losses at a multimode fiber splice.
The horizontal coordinate reflects the <span class="eqn_il"><i>m</i></span> value of each mode, while the color depends on <span class="eqn_il"><i>l</i></span>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One may be surprised that the coupling loss for the LP<sub>14,3</sub> mode is so high &ndash; about 10&nbsp;dB, far higher than according to the ratio of mode areas (1.94&nbsp;dB).
However, that mode has a high portion of its power outside the radius of 25&nbsp;&mu;m, and in addition its intensity distribution in Fourier space reaches quite far out.
The calculated result has been confirmed with a calculation based on numerical beam propagation, which is a quite independent check.</p>
<p>If one exchanges the two fibers, i.e., has an input coming from the smaller core, the coupling losses for all modes get much smaller:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/mm_fiber_splice2.png" alt="losses at multimode fiber splice">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;6:</span> 
Same as Figure&nbsp;3, but with the light input to the fiber with the smaller core.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So for multimode fibers, other than for single-mode fibers (see above), the coupling losses are substantially smaller when coming from the fiber with the smaller core.
However, for some modes these losses are still substantial &ndash; for example, 2.8&nbsp;dB for the LP<sub>55</sub> mode.
Numerical beam propagation confirmed that result.
It shows that the field, when it gets into the fiber with larger core, starts to expand, and that expansion is later on not fully stopped at the new core/cladding boundary.
This shows that not every field distribution within the core and with limited angular content can be well matched by the guided modes.</p>
<p>Such effects are less pronounced for fibers having many modes.
Basically, one has to be aware that the modes of the smaller core span a mathematical space which is <em>not</em> a subspace of that for a larger core.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Effects of Air Gaps</h3>
<div>
<p>In mechanical splices and connections based on fiber couplers, a tiny air gap can be formed between the two end faces.
One might expect that this leads to a substantial <a href="insertion_loss.html" title="power losses due to insertion of a device">insertion loss</a> and low <a href="return_loss.html" title="a measure for how much reflected light is attenuated">return loss</a> via the <a href="fresnel_reflections.html" title="light reflections at optical interfaces">Fresnel reflections</a> from the end faces.
This is not true, however, if the size of the air gap is much smaller than the optical wavelength.
In that situation, there is nearly a <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&pi;</span></span> phase shift between the two reflections, so that these largely cancel each other by destructive <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a>.</p>
<p>Even for somewhat larger air gaps, the distance between the fiber ends is usually at least well below the <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a>, so that no significant wavefront curvature can occur on that path length.
One may then approximately calculate the overall <a href="transmittance.html" title="the ratio of transmitted optical power to the incident optical power at some partial transparent object">transmittance</a> and <a href="reflectance.html" title="the ratio of reflected optical power to the incident optical power at some reflecting object">reflectance</a> using simple formulas for <a href="fabry_perot_interferometers.html" title="interferometers consisting of two highly reflecting mirrors, forming a standing-wave resonator">Fabry&ndash;P&eacute;rot interferometers</a>.
Figure&nbsp;4 shows results for silica fibers.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_air_gap.png" alt="effect of air gap between fibers">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;7:</span> 
Insertion loss and return loss resulting from an air gap at a mechanical fiber splice.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the worst case, one obtains 0.6&nbsp;dB of insertion loss.
For less than 0.1&nbsp;dB, the air gap width should be smaller than 0.07 wavelengths &ndash; for example, 105&nbsp;nm for an 1.5-&mu;m wavelength.
If a distance near half a wavelength or one wavelength could be kept stable, this would also allow for very low coupling losses.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Fiber Connectors</h3>
<div>
<p><a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">Fiber connectors</a> are often used at the ends of <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber cables</a> in order to provide non-permanent connections between fiber-coupled devices.
In principle, they are used in a similar manner as electrical connectors.
However, their use typically requires some more care, because fiber ends are relatively sensitive, and because fiber connectors are not always easy to attach to a fiber end.</p>
<p>Note that even a tiny particle of dust on the fiber core can cause substantial losses.
(Therefore, one often protects a fiber connector with a dust cap during times when it is not plugged in.)
Also, small imperfections of a fiber end may lead to a small air gap between the fiber ends, which causes reflection losses (see above).</p>
<p>A great variety of fiber connectors has been developed, e.g. for applications in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>.
Some common types are ST, FC, SC and LC connectors.
The different connectors types differ in various aspects, e.g. in terms of cost, size, ease of use, insertion loss and return loss, suitable fiber size, allowed number of mating cycles, suitability for <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode</a>, <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> and <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fibers</a> and various other details.</p>
<p>For more details, see our encyclopedia article on <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a>.
<a href="passive_fiber_optics13.html">Part 13 on fiber accessories and tools</a> may also be helpful.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Fiber Pigtails</h3>
<div>
<p>Various optical components such as <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a> and <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> are often sold with fiber &ldquo;pigtails&rdquo;.
This means that some fiber hangs out of the device, and the user may splice that to some other fiber, or attach a fiber connector to it.</p>
<p>One can also buy pure fiber pigtails, i.e., without an optical component.
In that case, one obtains a fiber connector on one end of a (typically short) fiber, and nothing on the other end.
One may, for example, integrate the open end into some device, and avoid the work of assembling a connector oneself.
Of course, one might also take some jumper cable and cut it into two pigtails.</p>
<p>Some fiber pigtails have only some polymer buffer, but not a thick jacket like a fiber patch cord.
There are also jacketed pigtails.</p>
