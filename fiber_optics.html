<p>Fiber optics is the technology based on optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, i.e., on mostly flexible <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a> for light.
The article on <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> describes the core technology, including various types of glass fibers (e.g. <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> and <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride fibers</a>) but also <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic optical fibers</a>.
Apart from the basic materials used, there can be differences in many other respects, particularly concerning the propagation characteristics of light in the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a>.
For example, there are</p>
<ul>

Light can be launched into a fiber, where it can propagate with a constant beam radius until it leaves the fiber.
One can also combine multiple fiber-optic elements.
In all-fiber setups, the light may entirely stay within fiber waveguides.

<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Cables</h2>
<div>
<p>In an <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="cables containing one or several optical fibers">optical fiber cable</a>, the actual fiber is embedded into a supporting structure, which protects it mostly against mechanical stress and moisture.
Such cables are often terminated with <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a>, so that they can be plugged in a similar way as electrical cables, although fiber-optic connections are tentatively more delicate.</p>
<p>Fiber cables can differ in many respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can contain different types of fibers, for example <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> or <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode</a> glass fibers or <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic fibers</a> with different specifications.</li>
<li>A cable can contain different numbers of fibers &ndash; between one and several hundred.</li>
<li>They can have different levels of protection, e.g. against mechanical damage and moisture.</li>
<li>In addition, some cables are fire-retardant.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details can be found in the article on <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber cables</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber-optic Components</h2>
<div>
<p>There are various types of fiber-optic elements, which may be connected with each other using fibers.
Some of these are essentially made of fibers, whereas others consist of utterly different materials but are coupled to fibers, i.e., they offer fibers for input and output purposes.
Some examples for fiber-optical components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">Fiber-coupled laser diodes</a> can be used as light sources.
One may also use <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> or other lasers in combination with a <a href="fiber_launch_systems.html" title="optical systems for launching light into optical fibers">fiber launch system</a>.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">Fiber couplers</a> can be used e.g. for combining light from different sources into one fiber, or as fiber splitters e.g. for distributing television (cable-TV) signals to different users.</li>
<li><a href="mode_field_converters.html" title="optical devices which allow for efficient coupling between modes of different sizes">Mode field converters</a> can efficiently couple light between fibers with different <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode areas</a>.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">Fiber Bragg gratings</a> can be used as strongly wavelength-selective reflectors, e.g. for add&ndash;drop multiplexers in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">telecom applications</a> with <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain">wavelength division multiplexing</a>.
Another application is the introduction of tailored wavelength-dependent losses, e.g. for <a href="gain_equalization.html" title="a technique for making the gain spectrum of an optical amplifier device flatter over a certain optical frequency range">gain flattening</a> of amplifier systems.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">Fiber connectors</a> allow one to have removable and reconfigurable connections between devices &ndash; similar to electrical connections, although often more sensitive.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_collimators.html" title="devices for collimating the light coming from a fiber, or for launching collimated light into the fiber">Fiber collimators</a> provide a connection between fiber optics and free-space optics: they can collimate the output from a fiber, or launch a collimated beam into a fiber.</li>
<li>Fiber-coupled <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolators</a>, <a href="faraday_rotators.html" title="devices which can rotate the polarization state of light, exploiting the Faraday effect">rotators</a> and circulators can be used for manipulations based on beam polarization.</li>
<li>There are various others fiber-coupled components for beam manipulation, such as fiber-optic <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">modulators</a> and <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorbers</a>.</li>
<li>There are fiber-coupled <a href="optical_power_meters.html" title="instruments for optical power measurements, based e.g. on heating of an absorber structure or a photodiode">power meters</a> and <a href="spectrometers.html" title="devices for separating spectral components">spectrometers</a> for monitoring <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> and <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">spectra</a>.
Other devices can monitor the <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html">polarization</a> state.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber-optic Setups</h2>
<div>
<p>One may combine multiple fiber-optical elements to obtain all-fiber setups with complex functionality.
For example, one can assemble <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> (<a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>, see below) from <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled laser diodes</a>, <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a> and <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a>.
Additional elements such as fiber-coupled <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorbers</a> and fibers for <a href="dispersion_compensation.html" title="the control of the overall chromatic dispersion of a system by adding optical elements with a suitable amount of dispersion">dispersion compensation</a> allow one to obtain <a href="mode_locking.html" title="a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode-locked operation</a>, where the laser emits a train of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>.
One can also use elements for <a href="q_switching.html" title="a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>, <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">power stabilization</a>, <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tuning</a> and various other purposes.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Amplifiers and Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>In laser-<a href="active_fibers.html" title="optical fibers containing laser-active dopants in the fiber core">active fibers</a>, which are in most cases <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>, one can perform laser amplification processes based on <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a>.
The laser-active ions, e.g. Yb<sup>3+</sup>, Er<sup>3+</sup> or Tm<sup>3+</sup>, are pumped with some typically shorter-wavelength pump light, and can then amplify some signal light.
<a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">Fiber amplifiers</a> based on that technology can easily provide a power <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> of several tens of <a href="decibel.html" title="a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a>.
<a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">High-power</a> versions based on <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a> can generate average output powers of hundreds or even thousands of watts.
By incorporation of reflectors such as <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a>, or by building <a href="ring_resonators.html" title="optical resonators where light can independently circulate in two different directions">ring resonators</a>, one can also realize <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>.</p>

<p>Due to high laser <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, effects of <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a>, the <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level behavior</a> of typical laser-active ions in fibers, strong <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a> effects etc., the operation details of fiber amplifiers and lasers are often more complicated than those of bulk lasers.
Therefore, detailed <a href="laser_modeling.html" title="the investigation of phenomena and quantitative relations in lasers, using theoretical models and computational methods">laser modeling</a> is particularly important in this area in order to obtain a clear understanding, based on which device designs can be optimized.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Imaging with Fiber Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Fiber optics can also be used for <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> applications.
For example, there are imaging <a href="fiber_bundles.html" title="bundles of optical fibers">fiber bundles</a> which provide accurate image transfer by guiding light from each input point the corresponding output point with a typically rather small fiber.
They are used in endoscopes, for example.
Also, there are <a href="fiber_optic_plates.html" title="transparent plates containing many optical fibers">fiber-optic plates</a> (faceplates), which are rigid parts containing many fibers, sometimes many millions, and are used in <a href="night_vision_devices.html" title="instruments which allow viewing or imaging under conditions of very low light levels">night vision devices</a>, for example.
Besides the basic function of the image transfer, one can obtain (de)<a href="magnification.html" title="the enlargements of images">magnification</a> with <a href="fiber_optic_tapers.html" title="fiber-optic plates which are tapered for obtaining some image magnification">fiber-optic tapers</a> and also image inversion with twisted devices.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Comparison of Bulk Optics and Fiber Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Traditional bulk-optical setups comprise discrete optical elements such as <a href="mirrors.html" title="devices which reflect light">mirrors</a>, <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>, <a href="polarizers.html" title="optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizers</a>, <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">filters</a>, etc., whereas fiber optics may be use to make all-fiber setups.</p>
<p>The different technological approaches can differ in many respects:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The robustness is an important advantage &ndash; but only for all-fiber technology.</aside>
<ul>
<li>An important practical advantage of all-fiber setups is their robustness.
All components are connected with each other, so that they cannot become misaligned after fabrication.
Often, but not always, the contained fibers can be bent or twisted during operation without any detrimental effects.
Different parts of a setup can be mounted on parts which are not rigidly connected with each other.
As the light is entirely kept within the cores and closed optical components, there is no risk that dirt and dust particles can effect it.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">The higher flexibility of bulk optics is convenient in development, testing and maintenance.</aside>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, a bulk-optical setup is often more convenient during development, testing and maintenance, as one can more easily remove or replace components and access beams e.g. in order to measure their powers or beam profiles.
One can thus more easily identify and cure the reason of faults or optimize single components.
Also, one may easily change e.g. the beam sizes within a whole bulk laser setup by exchanging a single mirror or changing its position, whereas such an operation in a fiber-optic setup would require one to replace all or most components.</li>
<li>Bulk-optical elements are often easier to procure.
A problem with fiber-optic elements is that various additional parameters such as <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">mode sizes</a>, <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining</a> guidance or not, type and thickness of protective coating, etc. make it more difficult for suppliers to fabricate all combinations of interest and keep these on stock.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">Fiber-optical technology can result in significant savings on opto-mechanical parts.</aside>
<ul>
<li>Bulk-optical setups often need to contain a lot of expensive positioning equipment (<a href="opto_mechanics.html" title="mechanical elements used in optics">opto-mechanics</a>), and each fabricated device must undergo an alignment procedure which is not always easy to automate.
Fiber-optical setups also need fine alignments, but usually only during fabrication, so that there can be large savings on opto-mechanical parts.
On the other hand, the required lab equipment for working with fiber optics comprises expensive things such as <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicers</a>.
Therefore, cost savings with fiber optics are more likely for large quantities, but not for small quantities, as they often occur in <a href="optics.html" title="the science and technology dealing with the properties and the propagation of light">optical technology</a>.</li>
<li>The article on <a href="fiber_lasers_versus_bulk_lasers.html">fiber lasers versus bulk lasers</a> discusses various specific aspects in the context of <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> &ndash; among others, influences on the technology on the possible performance of laser devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, bulk and fiber technologies are also used in mixed forms, where the light partly travels through air and bulk-optical elements and partly through fibers.
One may then obtain advantages of both technologies, but also disadvantages of both.
For example, the robustness of a fiber-optical solution may be lost entirely if a setup contains only a single free-space beam path.
(Note that re-launching light into a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a> requires a more sensitive alignment than that in many bulk-optical setups.)</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Important Applications of Fiber Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>In the following, we briefly discuss some particularly important areas of application in photonics technology:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Optical fiber communications is perhaps the most prominent example for the enormous importance of fiber optics.</aside>
<ul>
<li><a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">Optical fiber communications</a> have become a core element of information technology, allowing the extremely fast and low-cost transmission of mostly digital data for telephony, video and television (cable-TV) signals, regional data networks, computing, etc.
It is getting even more important with the widespread deployment of <a href="fiber_to_the_home.html" title="the technology of providing data connections to private homes via optical fibers rather than electric cables">fiber to the home</a> technology for providing fast Internet access to many companies and households, surpassing the performance of copper cable technology.
The development of the Internet profits enormously from modern fiber optics.
This holds not only for passive <a href="telecom_fibers.html" title="optical fibers for use in optical fiber communications">telecom fibers</a>, which are used for the actual data transmission, but also for additional technology such as <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> for compensating fiber losses, <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a> for combining or splitting of signals, <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a> for filtering purposes, <a href="specialty_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with special designs or materials">specialty fibers</a> for nonlinear data processing and various others fiber-optic devices.
Glass fibers now totally dominate long-haul data transmission with data rates often reaching multiple terabits per second even in a single fiber; a cable can contain multiple such fibers.
Even for short-distance transmission of information in buildings or even within apparatuses, fiber optics gains more and more ground &ndash; partly in the form of <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic optical fibers</a>.</li>
<li>Various types of <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> have become important light sources not only for low-power applications, but even for <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">very high output powers</a> in the domain of multiple kilowatts of average power and megawatts to gigawatts of <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> (at least in conjunction with bulk-optical <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compressors</a>).
They compete with various types of bulk lasers, and depending on many circumstances, one of these technologies may be more appropriate.
For more details, see the article on <a href="fiber_lasers_versus_bulk_lasers.html">fiber lasers versus bulk lasers</a>.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="optical sensors based on fiber devices">Fiber-optic sensors</a> for quantities like <a href="optical_temperature_sensors.html" title="temperature sensors based on optical technology, e.g. with fiber Bragg gratings">temperature</a>, stress and <a href="optical_strain_sensors.html" title="sensors for mechanical strain based on optical technology, e.g. with fiber Bragg gratings">strain</a>, rotation, chemical compositions etc. have pervaded various fields, including aircraft &amp; space technology, oil exploration, and the monitoring of buildings (e.g. large bridges) and pipelines.
Both localized and distributed fiber-optic sensors, based on a wide range of physical principles, are nowadays applied in many fields.</li>
<li>Many fibers simply transport light from a source to an application &ndash; for example, from a high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> setup to a <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk laser</a>, from a laser diode to a light-powered sensor system on a high-voltage transmission line (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="power_over_fiber.html" title="delivery of power for electronic devices via light in an optical fiber"><em>power over fiber</em></a>), or from a high-power <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a> to a welding robot in a car factory.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Modeling of Fiber Devices</h2>
<div>
<p>Physical modeling is often crucial for analyzing and optimizing the operation details of fiber-optic devices.
Many different aspects can be the subject of such modeling:</p>
<ul>
<li>The properties of the guided <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> depend in non-trivial ways on the fiber designs &ndash; not just the glass composition, but also the <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> properties.
Optimized mode structures are often crucial for the performance of glass fibers.</li>
<li>Although many aspects of light propagation can be described on the basis of <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>, numerical beam propagation is often required, e.g. for studying effects of imperfections, bending and other external influences.
Also, a mode-based analysis may not be practical in situations with a very large number of modes.</li>
<li>The behavior of rare-earth ions in active devices (<a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">lasers</a>) is essential for the power conversion in such devices.
As extreme conditions in terms of intensities and gains often occur in <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="optics based on optical fibers">fiber-optic</a> devices, such modeling is tentatively more sophisticated than in <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>.</li>
<li>The propagation of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> in fibers introduces additional aspects such as influences of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>.
Note that such effects are particularly strong in fibers due to the typically long device length and small <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For many such aspects, <a href="fiber_simulation_software.html" title="software for numerical simulations on fiber devices">fiber simulation software</a> is used &ndash; particularly for various kinds of numerical simulations.</p>
