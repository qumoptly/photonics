<p>The numerical aperture (NA) of an optical system (e.g. an <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> system) is a measure for its angular acceptance for incoming light.
It is defined based on <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">geometrical</a> considerations and is thus a theoretical parameter which is calculated from the optical design.
It cannot be directly measured, except in limiting cases with rather large apertures and negligible <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> effects.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Numerical Aperture of an Optical System</h2>
<div>
<p>The numerical aperture of an optical system is defined as the product of the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> of the beam from which the light input is received and the sine of the maximum ray angle against the axis, for which light can be transmitted through the system based on purely geometric considerations (<em>ray optics</em>):</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/na_def.gif" width="105" height="24" alt="definition of numerical aperture"></div>
<p>For the maximum incidence angle, it is demanded that the light can get through the whole system and not only through an entrance aperture.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">NA of a Lens</h3>
<div>
<p>A simple case is that of a collimating lens:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/na_lens.png" alt="numerical aperture of a lens">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A collimating lens can theoretically accept light from a cone, the opening angle of which is limited by its size.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The extreme rays are limited by the size of the lens, or in some cases somewhat less if there is a non-transparent facet.</p>
<p>It is often not recommended to operate a lens or its full area, since there could be substantial <a href="spherical_aberrations.html" title="optical aberrations resulting from spherical optical surfaces">spherical aberrations</a>.
The numerical aperture, however, is a completely geometrical measure, which is not considering such aspects.</p>
<aside class="callout red">The numerical aperture depends on the location of the object plane determined by the designer!</aside>
<p>In the example case above, the numerical aperture of the lens is determined by its diameter and its <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a>.
Note, however, that a lens may not be designed for collimating light, but for example for <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> objects in a larger distance.
In that case, one will consider rays coming from that object distance, and the obtained numerical aperture will be correspondingly smaller &ndash; sometimes even much smaller.
This shows that the numerical aperture depends on the location of some object plane determined by the designer according to the intended use.</p>
<p>Some lenses are used for focusing <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated</a> <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a> to small spots.
The numerical aperture of such a lens depends on its aperture and focal length, just as for the collimation lens discussed above.
The <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>lens</sub></span> at the lens must be small enough to avoid truncation or excessive <a href="spherical_aberrations.html" title="optical aberrations resulting from spherical optical surfaces">spherical aberrations</a>.
Typically, it will be of the order of half the aperture radius of the lens (or perhaps slight larger), and in that case (<span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>lens</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>D</i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;4&thinsp;=&thinsp;NA&thinsp;&middot;&thinsp;<i>f</i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;2</span>, with the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> angle being only half the NA) the achievable beam radius in the focus is</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/w_f.gif" width="176" height="45" alt="beam radius in focus"></div>
<p>where <span class="eqn_il"><i>D</i></span> is the aperture diameter, <span class="eqn_il"><i>f</i></span> the <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a> and <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span></span> the optical wavelength.
Note that the calculation is based on the <a href="paraxial_approximation.html" title="a frequently used approximation, essentially assuming small angular deviations of the propagation directions from some beam axis">paraxial approximation</a> and therefore not accurate for cases with very high NA.</p>
<p>A somewhat smaller spot size may be possible with correspondingly larger input beam radius, if the performance is not spoiled by aberrations.
In case of doubt, one should ask the manufacturer what maximum input beam radius is appropriate for a certain lens.</p>
<p>High-NA lenses are required for various applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>In players and recorders of optical data storage media such as CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs it is important to focus laser light to a small spot (pit) and receive light from such a spot.</li>
<li>Lenses with high NA are also required for <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimating</a> <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a> which originate from small apertures.
For example, this is the case for low-power single-mode <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>.
When a lens with too low NA is used, the resulting collimated beam can be distorted (aberrated) or even truncated.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">NA of a Microscope Objective</h3>
<div>
<p>The same kind of considerations apply to <a href="microscope_objectives.html" title="the optical component of a microscope which is next to the observed object">microscope objectives</a>.
Such an objective is designed for operation with a certain <a href="working_distance.html" title="the distance between an objective and the object">working distance</a>, and depending on the type of <a href="microscopes.html" title="instruments for seeing very small objects">microscope</a> with which it is supposed to be used, it 
may be designed for producing an image at a finite distance or at infinity.
In any case, the opening angle on which the numerical aperture definition is based is taken from the center of the intended object plane.
It is usually limited by the <a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">optical aperture</a> on the object side, i.e., at the light entrance.</p>
<p>In many cases, the light input comes from air, where the refractive index is close to 1.
The numerical aperture is then necessarily smaller than 1, but for some microscope objectives it is at least not much lower, for example 0.9.
Other microscope objectives for particularly high image resolution are designed for the use of some immersion oil between the object and the entrance aperture.
Due to its higher refractive index (often somewhat above 1.5), the numerical aperture can then be significantly larger than 1 (for example, 1.3).</p>
<p>The NA of a microscope objective is important particularly concerning the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>It determines how bright the observed image can be for a given illumination intensity.
Obviously, a high-NA objective can collect more light than one with a low numerical aperture.</li>
<li>More importantly, the NA sets a limit to the obtained spatial resolution: the finest resolvable details have a diameter of approximately <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span>&thinsp;/&thinsp;(2&thinsp;NA)</span>, assuming that the objective does not produce excessive image aberrations.</li>
<li>A high NA leads to a small <a href="depth_of_field.html" title="the distance between the nearest and furthest objects that can be imaged with reasonably sharp focus for a given focus setting">depth of field</a>: only objects within a small range of distances from the objective can be seen with a sharp image.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Photographic Objectives</h3>
<div>
<p>In photography, it is <em>not</em> common to specify the numerical aperture of an objective, because such objectives are not thought to be used with a fixed working distance.
Instead, one often specifies the aperture size with the so-called <a href="f_number.html" title="a measure for the open aperture of a photographic objective"><em>f-number</em></a>, which is the <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a> divided by the diameter of the <a href="entrance_and_exit_pupil.html" title="the apparent apertures of an optical system, seen from the object or image side">entrance pupil</a>.
Usually, such an objective allows the adjustment of the f-number in a certain range.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Numerical Aperture of an Optical Fiber or Waveguide</h2>
<div>
<p>Although an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> or other kind of <a href="waveguides.html" title="spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> can be seen as a special kind of optical system, there are some special aspects of the term <em>numerical aperture</em> in such cases.</p>
<p>In case of a <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index fiber</a>, one can define the numerical aperture based on the input ray with the maximum angle for which <a href="total_internal_reflection.html" title="the phenomenon that light incident on the boundary between two transparent media is fully reflected if the light is coming from the optical more dense medium and the angle of incidence is sufficiently large">total internal reflection</a> is possible at the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a>&ndash;<a href="fiber_cladding.html" title="the area(s) around the core of an optical fiber">cladding</a> interface:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_acceptance_angle.png" alt="acceptance angle of a fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
An incident light ray is first refracted and then undergoes <a href="total_internal_reflection.html" title="the phenomenon that light incident on the boundary between two transparent media is fully reflected if the light is coming from the optical more dense medium and the angle of incidence is sufficiently large">total internal reflection</a> at the core&ndash;cladding interface. However, that works only if the incidence angle is not too large.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The numerical aperture (NA) of the fiber is the sine of that maximum angle of an incident ray with respect to the fiber axis.
It can be calculated from the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> difference between core and cladding, more precisely with the following relation:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/na_fiber.gif" width="158" height="32" alt="numerical aperture"></div>
<p>Note that the NA is independent of the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> of the medium around the fiber.
For an input medium with higher refractive index, for example, the maximum input angle will be smaller, but the numerical aperture remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The equation given above holds only for straight fibers.
Fort bent fibers, one may use an approximate modified equation, which also contains the bend radius <span class="eqn_il"><i>R</i></span> and the core diameter:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/na_fiber_bent.gif" width="224" height="53" alt="numerical aperture of bent fiber"></div>
<p>For fibers or other waveguides not having a step-index profile, the concept of the numerical aperture becomes questionable.
The maximum input ray angle then generally depends on the position of the input surface.
Some authors calculate the numerical aperture of a graded-index fiber based on the maximum refractive index difference between core and cladding, using the equation derived for step-index fibers.
However, some common formula in fiber optics involving the NA can then not be applied.</p>
<p>Light propagation in most optical fibers, and particularly in <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>, cannot be properly described based on a purely geometrical picture (with <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">geometrical optics</a>), because the wave nature of light is very important; <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> becomes strong for tightly confined light.
Therefore, there is no close relation between properties of fiber <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> and the numerical aperture.
Only, high-NA fibers tend to have modes with larger <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">divergence</a> of the light exiting the fiber.
However, that beam divergence also depends on the core diameter.
As an example, Figure&nbsp;3 shows how the mode radius and mode divergence of a fiber depend on the core radius for fixed value of the numerical aperture.
The mode divergence stays well below the numerical aperture.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/mode_divergence1.png" alt="mode radius and divergence vs. core radius">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Mode radius and divergence angle for the fundamental mode of a step-index fiber as functions of the core radius for a fixed numerical aperture of 0.1 and the wavelength of 1000&nbsp;nm.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In Figure&nbsp;4 one can see that the angular intensity distribution somewhat extends beyond the value corresponding to the numerical aperture.
This demonstrates that the angular limit from the purely geometrical consideration is not a strict limit for waves.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/mode_divergence2.png" alt="far field of fiber mode">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
<a href="near_field_and_far_field.html" title="the optical field either close to a source or object or far from it">Far field</a> intensity distribution of a fiber mode at 1000&nbsp;nm for a core radius of 3.5&nbsp;&mu;m, a numerical aperture of all 0.1. The intensity distribution somewhat extends beyond the value corresponding to the numerical aperture (see the vertical line).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>, the NA is typically of the order of 0.1, but can vary roughly between 0.05 and 0.4.
Because <a href="wave_optics.html" title="the description of optical phenomena based on wave models">wave optics</a> effects are particularly important for single-mode fibers, but ignored in considerations based on the NA, those values are not particularly relevant for calculations.
<a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">Multimode fibers</a> typically have a higher numerical aperture of e.g. 0.3.
Very high values are possible for <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>.</p>
<p>A higher NA has the following consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a given mode area, a fiber with higher NA is more strongly guiding, i.e. it will generally support a larger number of <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>.</li>
<li>Single-mode guidance requires a smaller <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> diameter.
The corresponding mode area is smaller, and the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">divergence</a> of the beam exiting the fiber is larger.
The fiber <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearity</a> is correspondingly increased.
Conversely, a <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area single-mode fiber</a> must have a low NA.</li>

<p>What is the equation that relates the divergence of the laser beam to the fiber core (105&nbsp;&mu;m) and the numerical aperture of the optical fiber?</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>As an rule of thumb, the half-angle <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> in radians should not exceed the NA of the fiber, regardless of the core diameter.
Then you should be able to get most of the light launched, assuming that is also all hits the fiber core at the interface.</p>

<p>What is the NA of a Nd:YAG laser rod with a certain diameter for total internal reflection?</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>The critical angle for <a href="total_internal_reflection.html" title="the phenomenon that light incident on the boundary between two transparent media is fully reflected if the light is coming from the optical more dense medium and the angle of incidence is sufficiently large">total internal reflection</a> is <span class="eqn_il">arcsin(1&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>n</i><sub>YAG</sub>)</span>, but note that this is measured against the surface normal.
The angle against the rod axis is <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&pi;</span>&thinsp;/&thinsp;2&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;arcsin(1&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>n</i><sub>YAG</sub>)</span>, and the sine of that gives you the NA.</p>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<p class="comment_details">2020-05-20</p>
<p>In your discussion on the NA of a lens above you provide the equation <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>lens</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>D</i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;4&thinsp;=&thinsp;NA&thinsp;&middot;&thinsp;<i>f</i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;2</span>.
Why is there a 1/2 factor in the NA definition? Does this mean NA is normally full angle for lenses? </p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>No, that factor results from the assumption that the beam radius is chosen to be only half the NA in order to avoid substantial beam clipping and aberrations.</p>

<p>Could you comment on the effect of the clear aperture of the lens (provided by manufacturers), and the impact of spherical aberrations for w = D/4 vs. D/3 (99.9&#37; vs. 99&#37; transmitted of a Gaussian beam)?</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>The clear aperture defines the area to which the light should be restricted.
That does not directly translate into a limit for Gaussian beams, which do not have a clear boundary.
One will usually limit the Gaussian beam radius to be significantly below that aperture radius &ndash; e.g. 2/3 of it.</p>
<p>The impact of spherical aberrations depends both on the lens design and the whole optical setup.</p>

<p>If I have a light beam entering an optical fiber at a slight angle to the optic axis, is all of this beam collected by the SM fiber (ignoring the 4&#37; reflection)?
The light path is still well within the numerical aperture of the fiber, but is nevertheless some of the light lost to the coating because the light is not absolutely on axis?</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Answer from the <a href="paschotta.html" style="font-weight:bold">author</a>:</p>
<p>Indeed, some of the light will then be lost, i.e., not get into the guided mode.
You can fully launch into the fundamental mode only if you have the perfect amplitude profile, including flat phase fronts perpendicular to the core axis.
Particularly for single-mode fibers, the numerical aperture is <em>not</em> providing an accurate criterion.</p>
