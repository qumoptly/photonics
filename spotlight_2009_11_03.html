<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>; F. Kusonoki et al., &ldquo;Narrow-band thermal radiation with low directivity by resonant modes inside tungsten microcavities&rdquo;, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. Part 1, 43 (8), 5253 (2004)</p>
<p>We have often read that <a href="laser_light.html" title="light generated with a laser device">laser light</a> is coherent, light from a bulb is incoherent, therefore you can well focus laser light but not light from a bulb.
The matter deserves some more thoughts, however.</p>
<p>Why actually is light from a bulb (<a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">incandescent lamp</a>) incoherent?
Does that property apply to any thermally generated light?
This is actually a bad question, since one should make clear whether we talk about <em>temporal</em> or <em>spatial</em> coherence.
Let us look at both aspects.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Temporal Coherence</h2>
<div>
<p>The temporal coherence of light is intimately related to its optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
Typically, <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">thermal radiation</a> is very broadband.
If it is blackbody radiation, its spectrum is described by Planck's formula.
At least for solid-state devices, one always expects a broadband spectrum, so there seems to be no way that a bulb could generate light with a high temporal coherence.</p>
<p>However, it is physically possible that even a solid-state surface exhibits strongly wavelength-dependent absorption and emission characteristics, so that the spectral shape of thermal radiation exhibits significant peaks and thus deviates strongly from a Planck-type shape.
As an example, some Japanese researchers (see the above reference, Kusonoki et al.) have investigated microstructured tungsten surfaces (with a periodic array of microcavities), the emission of which exhibits strong peaks with a bandwidth well below 1&thinsp;&mu;m.
Although this is still far from reaching the temporal coherence of a laser, it demonstrates that at least substantial increases of temporal coherence are possible for thermally generated light.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Spatial Coherence</h2>
<div>
<p>The poor spatial coherence of light from a bulb has relatively little to do with the process (thermal emission) which generates that light.
The actual point is the large emitting surface.
If one could reduce the emitting area to the order of a micron squared, the resulting spatial coherence would surpass that of various lasers.
There are only two difficulties with a strategy of reducing the emitting area:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is technical difficult to obtain a very small and very hot body, which is electrically connected while avoiding that the heat quickly escapes via these connections.
This consideration suggests the use of some contactless heating method, i.e., a departure from the principle of a simple bulb.</li>
<li>Even if one could achieve a small emitting area, this would imply a low emitted power.
Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation, assuming an emitting area of 1&thinsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> and a temperature of 3000&thinsp;K (typical for an incandescent lamp), we would obtain a radiated power of only 4.6&thinsp;&mu;W.
Higher temperatures would help a lot, as the power scales with the fourth power of the temperature, but there are obviously severe limits to that strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>At least in one dimension, the filament of a bulb may be fairly small.
If the filament diameter is 0.1&thinsp;mm and the filament is kept precisely straight, the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> of the emitted light at least in the direction perpendicular to the filament axis is roughly comparable with that of the slow axis direction of a high-power <a href="diode_bars.html" title="a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bar</a>.
Of course, in the other direction the beam quality is extremely poor, whereas the diode bar exhibits a fairly high beam quality in the fast axis direction.</p>
<p>How can <a href="laser_light.html" title="light generated with a laser device">laser light</a> be spatially coherent even if the emitting area is large?
This results from the laser process, which kind of coordinates the emission over the whole beam area.
The <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> defines a set of <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a>, and <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a> means that excited laser-active atoms or ions are forced to emit exactly into one mode or at least some limited number of modes.</p>

<h2>Photonics in Times of Trouble for International Trade</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">This <a href="./spotlight_2017_02_17.html?banner=International_trade">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> addresses the current serious concerns about the future of international trade and more generally international cooperation. Some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>German trade surplus</b> deserves attention, but claiming unfair practices without differentiating between different sectors of the economy is just stupid talk.</li>
<li>Already announced changes of US policy constitute a serious threat of beginning <b>trade wars</b>, which could have disastrous consequences.</li>
<li>There are also <b>ruthless attacks on essential values</b>, contributing to a breakdown of cooperation.</li>
<li>If we do not stop these developments in time, we may get into the <b>big crunch</b>.</li>
<li>We must <b>fiercely defend fundamental values</b> as well as <b>international cooperation</b>, because this is the only chance to solve a wide range of serious problems.</li>
