</header>
<p>Early attempts to scientifically describe light and <a href="optics.html" title="the science and technology dealing with the properties and the propagation of light">optical</a> phenomena were based on corpuscular theories (developed by René Descartes, Isaac Newton and others), assuming light to consist of small particles which at least in free space travel along straight lines with a velocity.
That fits to <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">geometrical optics</a>, where light is represented by geometrical rays.
From the 17<sup>th</sup> century on, scientists like Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens followed more closely the evidence for the wave nature of light, and this finally led to the wave theory of light (<em>wave optics</em>), which was mathematically worked out by Huygens (with publication in 1690, see Ref. [1]).
Based on that physical model, one could well describe the following important optical phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li>effects of <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> of light e.g. at narrow <a href="optical_slits.html" title="narrow openings through which light can be transmitted">optical slits</a> (later studied in more detail, e.g. by Thomas Young)</li>
<li><a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> phenomena</li>
<li><a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a> of light (with pioneering contributions from Augustin-Jean Fresnel)</li>
</ul>
<p>Only much later, in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, optical waves were identified with electromagnetic waves by James Clerk Maxwell.
However, a lot of productive research in wave optics was already possible before that, i.e., without understanding the detailed physical nature of light waves.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Computational methods are vital in wave optics. They are often used with simplifying approximations for the sake of computational efficiency.</aside>
<p>Modern applications of wave optics can be mathematically based on Maxwell's equations as the most fundamental basis; one can directly derive a <em>wave equation</em> from it, which is a second-order differential equation in time and space.
For <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic light</a>, one obtains the Helmholtz equation.
In many cases one uses simplified equations which are approximate but fairly accurate in certain limited domains.
For example, one can often neglect the second-order derivative with respect to the <span class="eqn_il"><i>z</i></span> coordinate for fields propagating largely in <span class="eqn_il"><i>z</i></span> direction.
One also often uses the <a href="paraxial_approximation.html" title="a frequently used approximation, essentially assuming small angular deviations of the propagation directions from some beam axis">paraxial approximation</a>.
Scalar wave models, ignoring the transverse nature of electromagnetic waves, are also widely used in optics, e.g. for calculating <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>.
For some applications, one requires more sophisticated models for a full description of electromagnetic wave propagation.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:400px;">
<img src="img/fiberpower_launch_mm.gif" alt="intensity profiles at the end of a multimode fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Intensity profiles at the end of a <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fiber</a> for a variable input beam position, shown as animated graphics. Such calculations need to be based on wave optics; ray optics are not sufficient. The image is from a <a href="fiberpower_launch.html">case study</a> with the software <a href="fiberpower.html">RP Fiber Power</a>.

</figure>
<p>Wave optics is usually understood to be a completely classical approach, not taking into account any quantum effects.
<a href="quantum_optics.html" title="the part of optics which deals with quantum effects">Quantum optics</a> works with extended theories, where the electromagnetic field is treated on a new basis.
Wave properties of <a href="light.html" title="electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectral range, or sometimes in an extended spectral region">light</a> continue to play a central role, although some kind of particle character (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>) also became apparent.</p>
<p>A very important concept in wave optics is <a href="fourier_optics.html" title="the description of light propagation based on transverse spatial Fourier transforms">Fourier optics</a>, which essentially means the application of transverse spatial Fourier transforms.
This allows both for an intuitive qualitative explanation of various phenomena and design techniques and for quantitative calculations.
Such calculations can partly be done with analytical means only.</p>
<p>Frequently, numerical software is used for simulating light propagation based on some kind of wave equation.
While this approach can in principle be fairly general, computation time and memory requirements can be excessive when not using various restricting assumptions &ndash; for example, that light propagates essentially only in one direction.
As far as <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">geometrical optics</a> are sufficient for realistic descriptions, that approach is often preferred over wave optics because it is computationally much less demanding.</p>
<p>A related term is <em>physical optics</em>, which may be interpreted as the same as wave optics, or in a more restricted sense when certain approximations are applied.
The term emphasizes that such wave-based models are physically more realistic than <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">geometrical optics</a>, even if they are not based on full Maxwell's equations.</p>
