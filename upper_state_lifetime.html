<p>In a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>, amplification is associated with the population of an excited state, from which <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a> can occur.
Even without stimulated emission, the lifetime of this upper-level population is finite due to <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> and possibly due to additional <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> effects.
Typically, the upper-state population decays exponentially with a certain decay time (the <em>upper-state lifetime</em>), assuming the absence of pumping and stimulated emission.
More precisely, the decay time is the time after which this population has decayed to 1/e (&asymp;&thinsp;37&#37;) of the initial value.</p>
<p>Spontaneous emission leads to <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a>, the lifetime of which (<em>fluorescence lifetime</em>) is of course identical to the upper-state lifetime.</p>
<p>Ideally, the decay of the upper-state population is caused only by the unavoidable <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a>.
Under these conditions, the inverse lifetime (then called <a href="radiative_lifetime.html" title="lifetime of an electronic state in the (hypothetical) situation where only radiative processes depopulate that level"><em>radiative lifetime</em></a>) is</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/tau_rad.gif" width="334" height="48" alt="radiative lifetime"></div>
<p>This shows that the decay is fast for large laser <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a> and a large <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a>.</p>
<p>The decay rate is enhanced if there are additional transitions to other lower-lying energy levels.
In addition, the upper-state lifetime can be reduced by <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> processes, involving e.g. the deexcitation at impurities or crystal defects, or <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfers</a> between different laser ions.
The decay of the upper-state population is then not necessarily of exponential nature; non-exponential decay is frequently observed (particularly for measurements with sufficiently short pump <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a>).
For example, some quenching processes lead to a fast decay, as long as the upper-level population is high, but have little influence on later stages of the decay.</p>
<p>For some gain media such as <a href="chromium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media doped with chromium ions">Cr:forsterite and Cr:YAG</a>, the upper-state lifetime is strongly temperature-dependent.
The reason can be phonon-assisted <a href="non_radiative_transitions.html" title="transitions between energy levels of atoms or ions which are not associated with the emission of light">non-radiative</a> relaxation, which becomes stronger at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>An <em>effective upper-state lifetime</em> can be defined under lasing conditions, which includes the effect of <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a>.
For a <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">four-level laser medium</a>, the effective upper-state lifetime is reduced e.g. by a factor of 2 when the laser is <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">pumped</a> twice above the <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump power</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the lower laser level can also have a finite lifetime, the so-called <a href="lower_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the lower laser level in the absence of radiation"><em>lower-state lifetime</em></a>.</p>
<p>In the case of semiconductor devices (<a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifiers</a> and <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">lasers</a>), the upper-state lifetime is usually called the <em>carrier lifetime</em>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Typical Values</h2>
<div>
<p>The upper-state lifetimes of different kinds of laser gain media differ considerably:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming the existence of dipole-allowed transitions, excited levels of atoms or ions typically have lifetimes of the order of nanoseconds.</li>
<li>The lifetime of carriers in the conduction band of a direct <a href="band_gap.html" title="a range of energies for which there are no states of carriers in a medium">band gap</a> semiconductor (as used for <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a>) is also typically a few nanoseconds.</li>
<li><a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">Rare-earth-doped gain media</a> typically operate on <a href="forbidden_transitions.html" title="transitions between different energy levels of some atoms or ions for which dipole transitions are suppressed via symmetries">weakly allowed transitions</a>, leading to much longer lifetimes between a few microseconds (e.g. for <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">titanium&ndash;sapphire</a>) and &asymp;&thinsp;8&ndash;10 milliseconds (e.g. for <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a>).
Their upper laser levels are called metastable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the threshold powers for different gain media vary much less than the upper-state lifetimes do, since long upper-state lifetimes imply low emission cross sections, and the threshold power depends on the <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&sigma;</span>&minus;<span class="greek">&tau;</span></span> product (see below).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Importance for Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>A long upper-state lifetime in a laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> means that a significant <a href="population_inversion.html" title="a state of a medium where a higher-lying electronic level has a higher population than a lower-lying level">population inversion</a> can be maintained with a relatively low pump power.
The <a href="gain_efficiency.html" title="small-signal gain of an optical amplifier per unit pump power or per unit stored energy">gain efficiency</a> and thus also the <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump power</a> of a laser also depend on the emission <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross section</a> (apart from other factors); the threshold pump power is inversely proportional to the product of upper-state lifetime and emission cross section (called the <em><span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&sigma;</span>&minus;<span class="greek">&tau;</span></span> product</em>), at least for <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">four-level lasers</a>.</p>
<p>The upper-state lifetime also influences the <a href="laser_dynamics.html" title="the temporal evolution of quantities such as the optical power and gain in a laser">laser dynamics</a>, e.g. the <a href="relaxation_oscillations.html" title="small mutually coupled oscillations of the laser power and laser gain around their steady-state values">relaxation oscillations</a> and the tendency for <a href="spiking.html" title="the tendency of some lasers to emit spikes of output power, particularly after being switched on">spiking</a>.</p>
<p>A long upper-state lifetime is desirable for continuously pumped <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>, because it makes it possible to store large amounts of energy.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Measurement of the Upper-state Lifetime</h2>
<div>
<p>The upper-state lifetime can be measured e.g. by populating the upper laser level with a short laser <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a> and monitoring the decay of the <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a>.
Alternatively, one may use an <a href="optical_choppers.html" title="devices for periodically interrupting light beams">optical chopper</a> (typically, with a rotation disc) in conjunction with a continuous-wave laser beam, but the switching is then much slower; it may still be sufficient for lifetimes of the order of milliseconds are hundreds of microseconds.</p>
<p>Note that in highly doped media the measured upper-state lifetime may be increased by reabsorption of the fluorescence, particularly if radiation trapping due to <a href="total_internal_reflection.html" title="the phenomenon that light incident on the boundary between two transparent media is fully reflected if the light is coming from the optical more dense medium and the angle of incidence is sufficiently large">total internal reflection</a> at the surfaces of the medium enhances this effect [1,&thinsp;2].
Reabsorption effects can be suppressed by using a lightly doped powder of the substance immersed in a liquid with comparable refractive index, or by dominantly recording fluorescence from some edge of a sample, using a <a href="pinholes.html" title="circular holes, typically with diameters well below one millimeter">pinhole</a> (<em>pinhole method</em>).</p>
<p>Note that the fluorescence decay becomes non-exponential in situations with significant reabsorption.
Non-exponential decay can also result from various other conditions.</p>

<h2>Photonics in Times of Trouble for International Trade</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">This <a href="./spotlight_2017_02_17.html?banner=International_trade">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> addresses the current serious concerns about the future of international trade and more generally international cooperation. Some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>German trade surplus</b> deserves attention, but claiming unfair practices without differentiating between different sectors of the economy is just stupid talk.</li>
<li>Already announced changes of US policy constitute a serious threat of beginning <b>trade wars</b>, which could have disastrous consequences.</li>
<li>There are also <b>ruthless attacks on essential values</b>, contributing to a breakdown of cooperation.</li>
<li>If we do not stop these developments in time, we may get into the <b>big crunch</b>.</li>
<li>We must <b>fiercely defend fundamental values</b> as well as <b>international cooperation</b>, because this is the only chance to solve a wide range of serious problems.</li>
</ul>
