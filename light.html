<p>Light is generally understood to be electromagnetic radiation in a range of <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> where it is visible for human beings, i.e., where it can excite the retina of the human eye to create a visual impression.
However, in a technological context the term is often used for a substantially broader <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">spectral</a> range which also includes <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> and <a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a>; those are not visible, but in many respects have similar physical properties.</p>
<p>Light is not only the basis for one of the most essential human senses, but also the central phenomenon of the scientific and technical areas of <a href="optics.html" title="the science and technology dealing with the properties and the propagation of light">optics</a> and <a href="photonics.html" title="the science and technology of light">photonics</a>.
Therefore, the dealing with light has been enormously important for the progress of humanity in terms of science, technology and wealth, and the term <em>light</em> also occurs in many hundreds of articles of this <a href="encyclopedia.html">encyclopedia</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">General Properties of Light</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">High Frequencies, Potential for High Bandwidth</h3>
<div>
<p>Light is electromagnetic radiation with extremely high frequencies.
For visible light, those frequencies lie roughly between 400&nbsp;THz and 700&nbsp;THz.
That implies oscillation cycles with durations of only a few femtoseconds.</p>
<p>While some sources emit quasi-<a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic light</a>, having a well defined <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>, others can have a very large optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of hundreds of terahertz.</p>
<p>Optical frequencies are far too high to be directly measured with electronic means, for example.
Nevertheless, nowadays there are sophisticated methods for phase-coherently relating and optical frequency to a microwave frequency from an atomic clock, for example.
That enables one to measure optical frequencies with extremely high precision.
Conversely, it is possible to use highly precise <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules">optical frequency standards</a> and precisely derive lower-frequency electronic signals from those.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Ultrashort Light Pulses</h3>
<div>
<p>The potential of light to have an extremely high <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> is the basis for the possibility to generate extremely short light <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a> (flashes of light).
(Inevitably, a short pulse has a bandwidth which is at least of the order of the inverse pulse duration; therefore, there cannot be extremely short pulses not having a large bandwidth, as calculated with a Fourier transform.)
For pulse durations of at most a few tens of picoseconds, the term <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less"><em>ultrashort pulses</em></a> is common.
The shortest pulses which can be generated with certain <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a> sources have durations around 5 femtoseconds; still shorter durations are possible by applying techniques of nonlinear <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compression</a>.
The <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> then often substantially exceeds the visible range.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Short Wavelengths</h3>
<div>
<p>The high optical frequencies also imply rather short optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> according to the relation <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>c</i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<span class="greek">&nu;</span></span>, although the <a href="velocity_of_light.html" title="the velocity with which light propagates in a medium">velocity of light</a> is rather high: slightly below 300,000&nbsp;km/s in vacuum.</p>
<p>A consequence of the short optical wavelengths is that <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> and <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effects (i.e., typical wave phenomena) are not so easily observed; the <a href="wave_optics.html" title="the description of optical phenomena based on wave models">wave nature of light</a> is thus not very obvious in everyday life.
On the other hand, <a href="geometrical_optics.html" title="a concept of optics which is based on the propagation of light rays, ignoring wave properties of light">geometrical optics</a>, describing light propagation with rays, is for the same reason a useful approximation in many situations.
A <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated light beam</a> with high spatial coherence and a not too small diameter in its focus may propagate with approximately constant beam diameter over substantial distances, and somewhat resemble a ray.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Coherence</h3>
<div>
<p>Light can exhibit a low or high degree of <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> in two different forms: temporal coherence and spatial coherence.
While natural light sources often exhibit a low degree of coherence of both kinds, <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> can generate extremely coherent light.
See the article on <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Transverse Oscillations; Polarization States</h3>
<div>
<p>Just as other kinds of electromagnetic radiation, light waves are transverse waves.
That means that the underlying oscillations of the electric and magnetic field are in directions perpendicular to the propagation direction (at least in simple cases, e.g. for propagation through a homogeneous isotropic medium).
In some cases, the electric field of light oscillates in a well defined direction; the light is then said to be <em>linearly polarized</em>.
Under certain circumstances, for example for propagation through a <a href="birefringence.html" title="the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringent</a> <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">optical material</a>, light propagation depends on its direction of polarization.</p>
<p>There are other possible polarization states, including circular and elliptical polarization states; see the article on the <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization of light</a> for more details.
There is also <em>unpolarized light</em> with randomly changing polarization directions, not having any preferred direction.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Velocity of Light</h3>
<div>
<p>Light generally propagates with an extremely high velocity.
In vacuum, both the <a href="phase_velocity.html" title="the velocity with which phase fronts propagate in a medium">phase velocity</a> and <a href="group_velocity.html" title="the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium">group velocity</a> are slightly below 300,000&nbsp;km/s.
According to established theories of physics, no particles and no information transmission can be faster than that.</p>
<p>When propagating in a medium, lights generally has a different phase velocity and group velocity.
In most cases, particularly for usual <a href="optical_materials.html" title="materials used for optical components">optical materials</a>, both velocities are substantially reduced.
The phase velocity is reduced by the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>, while the group velocity is reduced by the <a href="group_index.html" title="the ratio of the vacuum velocity of light to the group velocity in a medium">group index</a>.</p>
<p>There are certain situations where the phase velocity of light in a medium is even larger than the vacuum velocity of light (<em>fast light</em> &rarr;&nbsp;<a href="superluminal_transmission.html" title="transport of some quantity with a velocity exceeding that of light in vacuum">superluminal transmission</a>).
Even the group velocity can sometimes be higher than that, but without transferring information with that superluminal speed.
On the other hand, there are cases where the group velocity becomes far lower than usual (<em>slow light</em>).</p>
<p>See the articles on the <a href="velocity_of_light.html" title="the velocity with which light propagates in a medium">velocity of light</a> and <a href="superluminal_transmission.html" title="transport of some quantity with a velocity exceeding that of light in vacuum">superluminal transmission</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Wave Nature and Particle-like Aspects</h3>
<div>
<p>In many respects, light phenomena can be very well described with <a href="wave_optics.html" title="the description of optical phenomena based on wave models">wave optics</a>.
In fact, already in the 19<sup>th</sup> century light has been identified with electromagnetic waves by James Clerk Maxwell, so that even the physical nature of those waves seemed to be pretty clear.
It was thus a substantial surprise to find out in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century that in some respects light does not behave at all as expected for a wave phenomenon.
For example, the <a href="photoelectric_effect.html" title="the emission or excitation of electric carriers related to the absorption of light">photoelectric effect</a> was hard to explain based on a wave model.
Albert Einstein and others thought about the evidence for a kind of particle nature of light, and early quantum theory was developed in the following years.
That lead to a substantially more refined model for light, which finally reconciled the wave and particle nature.
The part of physics which deals with quantum effects of light (e.g. <a href="squeezed_states_of_light.html" title="nonclassical states of light with noise below the standard quantum limit in one quadrature component">squeezed states of light</a> and other kinds of <a href="nonclassical_light.html" title="light with properties which can be explained only within quantum optics">nonclassical light</a> with special <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a> properties) is called <a href="quantum_optics.html" title="the part of optics which deals with quantum effects">quantum optics</a>.</p>
<p>For the human mind, it still remains difficult to describe light both with waves and a kind of particles (<a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a>), which appear to belong to quite different categories.
However, it is now widely acknowledged that the current scientific description of light is quite satisfactory and complete, well consistent with a very wide range of observations, and not in conflict with any well established observations.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Energy Transport</h3>
<div>
<p>Light transports energy.
For example, Earth receives huge amounts of energy per day in the form of sunlight; a tiny fraction of that, converted to useful forms like electrical energy, could in principle satisfy the whole energy demands on Earth.
It is possible to directly convert light into electrical energy using photovoltaic cells; the conversion efficiency is often of the order of 20&#37;, but can be significantly larger in some cases, e.g. with tandem cells.</p>
<p>Because light can be tightly focused to small spots, provided that it exhibits a high degree of spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>, it allows one to deposit energy in highly controlled ways.</p>
<p>A further important aspect is the concentration of light energy in the time domain; intense ultrashort pulse may have enormously short <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a>, and can thus have extremely high <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a> even if the <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a> is quite moderate.
This combined with the focusing to tiny spatial regions is widely exploited in laser material processing.</p>
<p>Light may easily carry sufficient amounts of energy for causing hazards, particularly to eyes.
See the article on <a href="laser_safety.html" title="safety of the use of laser devices">laser safety</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Momentum Transport</h3>
<div>
<p>Light also carries mechanical momentum; the transfer of such momentum, e.g. in <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> processes, leads to <a href="light_forces.html" title="forces associated with absorption, reflection or scattering of light">light forces</a>.
Angular momentum can also be transferred.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Nonlinear Effect</h3>
<div>
<p>While the intensities of natural light are usually far too low to exhibit any nonlinear effects in materials, significant or even very strong nonlinearities can occur in conjunction with <a href="laser_light.html" title="light generated with a laser device">laser light</a>.
For example, that can lead to <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>, where light is converted to other optical frequencies.
See the article on <a href="nonlinear_optics.html" title="the part of optics dealing with optical nonlinearities and their applications">nonlinear optics</a> for details.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Light Sources</h2>
<div>
<p>Light can be generated by a wide range of sources.
The most important ones are briefly explained in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many natural light sources and some technical sources such as <a href="incandescent_lamps.html" title="light sources which produce thermal radiation from an electrically heated filament">incandescent lamps</a> are based on <a href="thermal_radiation.html" title="electromagnetic radiation which results from thermal emission">thermal radiation</a>.
For efficiently producing visible light, that requires temperatures of well above 1000&nbsp;K, so that the thermal energy <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i><sub>B</sub>&thinsp;<i>T</i></span> is no longer far below the photon energy <span class="eqn_il"><i>h<span class="greek">&nu;</span></i></span>.</li>
<li>Relatively efficient light generation is possible with electric discharges in gases, used in various kinds of <a href="gas_discharge_lamps.html" title="light sources which are based on an electrical discharge in an ionized gas or metal vapor">gas discharge lamps</a>.</li>
<li><a href="fluorescent_lamps.html" title="lamps which emit fluorescent light, usually generated by irradiation of a phosphor with light from an electric gas discharge">Fluorescent lamps</a> are also based on a gas discharge, but utilize a further conversion of the generated mostly ultraviolet light to visible light in a <a href="phosphors.html" title="substances which exhibit luminescence, used mostly for illumination and displays">phosphor</a>.</li>
<li>There is a wide range of <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> sources, spanning enormously large parameter regions e.g. in terms of output <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">power</a>, spectral width (<a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>), <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous emission</a> or <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a> generation with different <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Characterization of Light</h2>
<div>
<p>There are technical means for characterizing light in many different aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <a href="optical_power_meters.html" title="instruments for optical power measurements, based e.g. on heating of an absorber structure or a photodiode">optical power meters</a> and <a href="optical_energy_meters.html" title="instruments for measuring optical pulse energies">optical energy meters</a>, which may be applied, for example, for continuous-wave and pulsed lasers.
There are various kinds of <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> such as <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> for detecting light intensities.</li>
<li>The wavelength of <a href="monochromatic_light.html" title="light with a single optical frequency">monochromatic light</a> can be very accurately measured with <a href="wavemeters.html" title="devices for precise measurements of laser wavelengths">wavemeters</a>.
