<p>The linewidth (or line width) of a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>, e.g. a <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency laser</a>, is the width (typically the full width at half-maximum, FWHM) of its <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>.
More precisely, it is the width of the <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> of the emitted electric field in terms of frequency, <a href="wavenumber.html" title="the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumber</a> or <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, other <a href="spectral_lines.html" title="narrow spectral features related to emission or absorption lines of certain substances">spectral lines</a> e.g. from <a href="gas_discharge_lamps.html" title="light sources which are based on an electrical discharge in an ionized gas or metal vapor">gas discharge lamps</a> have certain linewidths, which can depend on the operation conditions.</p>
<p>The linewidth of a light beam is strongly (but non-trivially) related to the temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>, characterized by the <a href="coherence_time.html" title="a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the time over which the field correlation decays">coherence time</a> or <a href="coherence_length.html" title="a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the propagation distance over which the coherence significantly decays">coherence length</a>.
A finite linewidth arises from <a href="phase_noise.html" title="noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a> if the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phase</a> undergoes unbounded drifts, as is the case for free-running laser oscillators, for example.
(Phase fluctuations which are restricted to a small interval of phase values lead to a zero linewidth and some noise sidebands.)
Drifts of the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> length can further contribute to the linewidth and can make it dependent on the measurement time.
This shows that the linewidth alone, or even the linewidth complemented with a spectral shape (line shape), does by far not provide full information on the spectral purity of laser light.
(This is particularly the case for lasers with dominating low-frequency phase noise.)
More data are required for full <a href="noise_specifications.html" title="specifications for the noise properties of lasers, for example">noise specifications</a>.</p>
<p>The r.m.s. linewidth can be defined as the root-mean-square value of the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous optical frequency</a>:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/rms_lw.gif" width="150" height="60" alt="r.m.s. linewidth"></div>
<p>where usually some limited integration range for the noise frequencies is chosen.
This quantity can be more easily calculated from the <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>S</i><sub><span class="greek_small">&Delta;</span><span class="greek_small">&nu;</span></sub>(<i>f</i>)</span> of the instantaneous frequency.
Note, however, that the r.m.s. linewidth is not always a sensible measure; one should only use it in cases with strongly increasing <span class="eqn_il"><i>S</i><sub><span class="greek_small">&Delta;</span><span class="greek_small">&nu;</span></sub>(<i>f</i>)</span> for decreasing noise frequency (flicker noise), but not e.g. for white frequency noise.
The relation between the r.m.s. linewidth and the width of the optical spectrum is not trivial and depends on the shape of the frequency noise spectrum.</p>
<p><a href="narrow_linewidth_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers with a narrow optical emission spectrum">Lasers with very narrow linewidth</a> (high degree of monochromaticity) are required for various applications, e.g. as light sources for various kinds of <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a>, for <a href="laser_spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of laser light with matter is utilized">laser spectroscopy</a> (e.g. <a href="lidar.html" title="a technique for acquiring 3D images with laser pulses">LIDAR</a>), in coherent <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, and for test and measurement purposes.
Note that the achieved linewidth can be many orders of magnitude below the line with of the used <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transition</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Quantum Noise and Technical Noise</h2>
<div>
<p>The simplest situation is one where only <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> (<a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a>) introduces <a href="phase_noise.html" title="noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a>.
In that case, the noise of the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a> is white noise, i.e., its <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> is constant, and the emission spectrum is of Lorentzian shape.
The corresponding linewidth was calculated by Schawlow and Townes [] even before the first laser was experimentally demonstrated.
According to the modified <a href="schawlow_townes_linewidth.html" title="linewidth of a single-frequency laser with quantum noise only">Schawlow&ndash;Townes equation</a> (with a correction from M. Lax)</p>
<aside class="textbox tb_right greenmargin" style=" width:250px;">
<h2>Hear the Phase Noise!</h2>
<p>In order to get some feeling for phase noise, you can listen to the following short sound samples of a 440-Hz tone with different linewidths (white phase noise, no amplitude noise):</p>
<p>&nbsp; <a href="440_0.wav">0 Hz (no noise)</a>, <a href="440_1.wav">1 Hz</a>, <a href="440_5.wav">5 Hz</a>, <a href="440_10.wav">10 Hz</a></p>
<p>You can download these .wav files (each being &asymp;&thinsp;215&nbsp;KB long) and play them with any sound player software.</p>
<p>For comparison, if you temporally stretch the output of a 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser with a 10-kHz linewidth to 440&nbsp;Hz, the linewidth will be &asymp;&thinsp;16&nbsp;nHz &ndash; a pretty pure tone indeed!</p>
</aside>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/st_linewidth_mod.gif" width="149" height="52" alt="Schawlow--Townes linewidth"></div>
<p>the linewidth (FWHM) is proportional to the square of the resonator <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> divided by the output power (assuming that there are no parasitic resonator losses).
The article on the <a href="schawlow_townes_linewidth.html" title="linewidth of a single-frequency laser with quantum noise only">Schawlow&ndash;Townes linewidth</a> contains a more practical form of the equation.</p>
<p>The Schawlow&ndash;Townes limit is usually difficult to reach in reality, as there are various technical noise sources (e.g. mechanical vibrations, temperature fluctuations, and pump power fluctuations) which are difficult to suppress.
There are therefore certain compromises in <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a> for narrow linewidth.
For example, a long laser resonator leads to a small Schawlow&ndash;Townes linewidth, but makes it more difficult to achieve stable <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a> without mode hops, and to get a mechanically stable setup.</p>
<p>Typical measured linewidths of stable free-running <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> (e.g. for a measurement time of 1&nbsp;s) are a few kilohertz, which is far above the Schawlow&ndash;Townes limit.
Various sources of technical noise, e.g. fluctuations of the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> length, the pump power or the temperature of the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>, can be responsible for the increased linewidth.</p>
<p>The linewidths of monolithic <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a> are often in the megahertz range and are strongly increased above the Schawlow&ndash;Townes limit mainly by amplitude-phase coupling, as described with the <a href="linewidth_enhancement_factor.html" title="a parameter quantifying the amplitude&ndash;phase coupling in a laser">linewidth enhancement factor</a>.
There can also be excess noise from charge carrier fluctuations with a 1&thinsp;/&thinsp;f characteristic of the PSD of the frequency fluctuations.
In that case, the measurement time influences the measured linewidth value.</p>
<p>Much smaller linewidths, sometimes even below 1&nbsp;Hz, can be reached by <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">stabilization of lasers</a>, e.g. using ultrastable <a href="reference_cavities.html" title="optical cavities serving as a kind of frequency reference">reference cavities</a>.
Small linewidths are important, e.g. for <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopic</a> measurements and for application in <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Measurement of Laser Linewidth</h2>
<div>
<p>A laser linewidth can be measured with a variety of techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>For large linewidths (e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&nbsp;GHz, as obtained when multiple <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">modes</a> of the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> are oscillating), traditional techniques of <a href="optical_spectrum_analyzers.html" title="instruments for measuring optical spectra">optical spectrum analysis</a>, e.g. based on <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a>, are suitable.
A high frequency resolution is difficult to obtain in this way.</li>
<li>Another technique is to convert frequency fluctuations to intensity fluctuations, using an optical frequency discriminator, which can be, e.g., an unbalanced <a href="interferometers.html" title="optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometer</a> or a high-finesse <a href="reference_cavities.html" title="optical cavities serving as a kind of frequency reference">reference cavity</a>.
Again, the measurement resolution is quite limited.</li>
<li>For <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency lasers</a>, the <a href="self_heterodyne_linewidth_measurement.html" title="a technique for laser linewidth measurements, based on a beat note between the beam and a delayed version of itself">self-heterodyne technique</a> is often used, which involves recording a <a href="beat_note.html" title="an oscillation of the optical intensity arising from the superposition of light with different optical frequencies">beat note</a> between the laser output and a frequency-shifted and delayed version of it.</li>
<li>For sub-kilohertz linewidths, the ordinary self-heterodyne technique usually becomes impractical, as one would require a very large delay length, but it can be extended by using a <a href="recirculating_fiber_loops.html" title="fiber loops in which light can circulate many times">recirculating fiber loop</a> with an internal <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a>.</li>
<li>Very high resolution can also be obtained by recording a <a href="beat_note.html" title="an oscillation of the optical intensity arising from the superposition of light with different optical frequencies">beat note</a> between two independent lasers, where either the reference laser has significantly lower noise than the device under test, or both lasers have similar performance.
One can retrieve the instantaneous difference frequency e.g. with PLL (phase-locked loop) following the beat signal, or numerically from digitized recordings.
This method is conceptually very simple and reliable, but the requirement of a second laser (operating at a nearby <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>) can be inconvenient.
If linewidth measurements are required in a wide spectral range, a <a href="frequency_combs.html" title="optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines">frequency comb</a> source can be very useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that an optical frequency measurement always needs some kind of frequency (or timing) reference somewhere in the setup.
For <a href="narrow_linewidth_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers with a narrow optical emission spectrum">lasers with narrow linewidth</a>, only an optical reference can give a sufficiently accurate reference.
The self-heterodyne technique is a way to derive the frequency reference from the device under test itself by applying a large enough time delay, ideally avoiding any temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> between the original beam and the delayed version.
Therefore, long fibers are often used; however, long fibers tend to introduce additional phase noise due to temperature fluctuations and acoustic influences.</p>
<p>Particularly in cases with <span class="eqn_il">1&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>f</i></span> <a href="frequency_noise.html" title="noise of the instantaneous frequency of an oscillating signal">frequency noise</a>, a linewidth value alone may not be regarded as completely characterizing the phase noise.
It may then be better to measure the whole Fourier spectrum of the phase or <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a> fluctuations and characterize it with a <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a>; see also the article on <a href="noise_specifications.html" title="specifications for the noise properties of lasers, for example">noise specifications</a>.
Note also that <span class="eqn_il">1&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>f</i></span> frequency noise (or other noise spectra with strong low-frequency noise) can cause problems with some measurement techniques.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Minimization of Laser Linewidth</h2>
<div>
<p>The linewidth of a <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> depends strongly on the type of laser.
It may be further minimized by optimizing the <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a> and suppressing external noise influences as far as possible.
The first step should be to determine whether <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a> or classical noise is dominating, because the required measures can depend very much on this.</p>
<p>The influence of quantum noise (essentially spontaneous emission noise) is small for a laser with high intracavity power, low resonator losses, and a long resonator round-trip time.
Classical noise may be introduced via mechanical fluctuations, which can often be kept weaker for a compact short <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>, but note that resonator length fluctuations of a certain magnitude have a stronger effect in a shorter resonator.
Proper mechanical construction can minimize the coupling of the laser resonator to external vibrations and also minimize effects of thermal drift.
There can also be thermal fluctuations in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>, introduced e.g. by a fluctuating pump power.
For superior noise performance, various schemes for <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">active stabilization</a> can be employed, but it is often advisable first to use all practical passive methods.</p>
<p><a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">Single-frequency</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> can achieve linewidths of a few kilohertz, or sometimes even below 1&nbsp;kHz.
With serious efforts at <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">active stabilization</a>, sub-hertz linewidths are sometimes achieved.
The linewidth of a <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> is typically in the megahertz region, but it can also be reduced to a few kilohertz, e.g. in <a href="external_cavity_diode_lasers.html" title="non-monolithic diode lasers where the laser cavity (resonator) is completed with external optical elements">external-cavity diode lasers</a>, particularly with optical feedback from a high-<a href="finesse.html" title="the free spectral range divided by the FWHM width of the resonances of an optical resonator">finesse</a> <a href="reference_cavities.html" title="optical cavities serving as a kind of frequency reference">reference cavity</a>.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Problems Resulting from a Narrow Linewidth</h2>
<div>
<p>A narrow linewidth from a laser source is not always desirable:</p>
<ul>
<li>A large <a href="coherence_length.html" title="a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the propagation distance over which the coherence significantly decays">coherence length</a> implies that <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effects (e.g. due to weak parasitic reflections) can easily spoil the beam profile.
In laser projection displays, <a href="laser_speckle.html" title="light patterns resulting from the reflection of coherent light at rough surfaces">laser speckle</a> effects can disturb the image quality.</li>
<li>For transmission of light in passive or active optical <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, a narrow linewidth can cause problems due to stimulated <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a>.
It is then sometimes necessary to increase the optical linewidth, for example by fast dithering of the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a> via current modulation of a <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> or with an <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulator</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Linewidth in Other Context</h2>
<div>
<p>The term <em>linewidth</em> is also used for the width of optical transitions (e.g. a <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transition</a> or some <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a> feature).
For transitions in single atoms or ions at rest, the linewidth is related to the <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a> (more precisely, the lifetime of both upper and lower states) (<em>lifetime broadening</em>) and is called <em>natural linewidth</em>.
Significant linewidth broadening can be caused by movement of the atoms or ions (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="doppler_broadening.html" title="broadening of the linewidth of atomic transitions, caused by random motion of the emitting atoms"><em>Doppler broadening</em></a>) or by interactions, e.g. pressure broadening in gases or interactions with phonons in solid media.
If different atoms or ions are subject to different influences, this leads to <a href="inhomogeneous_broadening.html" title="the increase in the linewidth of an atomic transition caused by effects which act differently on different radiating or absorbing atoms">inhomogeneous broadening</a>.</p>
<p>The linewidth of a transition is often related to a <a href="q_factor.html" title="a measure of the damping of resonator modes"><i>Q</i> factor</a>, which is the frequency divided by the linewidth.</p>
