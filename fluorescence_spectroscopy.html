<p>Fluorescence spectroscopy denotes a class of <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized, e.g. for detecting substances or measuring concentrations">spectroscopy</a> methods which are based on the analysis of <a href="fluorescence.html" title="luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> light, particularly concerning the emission spectrum.
Properties of the fluorescence are frequently used to identify substances, often including their concentrations, and in other cases properties of a medium which influence details of the fluorescence.</p>
<p>The term <em>fluorescence spectrometry</em> is sometimes used instead of <em>spectroscopy</em> in order to emphasize that certain quantities are measured in a quantitative manner.</p>
<p>In contrast to absorption spectroscopy, one usually does not measure what happens to the applied excitation light (e.g. its <a href="absorbance.html" title="the logarithm with base 10 of the inverse transmittance">absorbance</a>), but observes only the properties of the fluorescent emission.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Operation Principles</h2>
<div>
<p>Fluorescence is actively excited by irradiating a sample with light from some light source which is part of the fluorometer (or fluorimeter).
(In many cases, one uses <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>.)
Further, there is some kind of <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a>, which may be combined with a tunable <a href="monochromators.html" title="optical devices which transmit only light in an adjustable small range of optical wavelengths">monochromator</a> (or sometimes only a few simple <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filters</a>) for spectral analysis.
Figure&nbsp;2 shows an example for a fluorometer setup.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:224px;">
<img src="img/fluorescence_excitation.png" alt="excitation of fluorescence">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Excitation of fluorescence at multiple wavelengths caused by the excitation with light at a single wavelength.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some fluorophore in the sample usually <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorbs</a> the incident excitation light via linear absorption (with one <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photon</a> per absorption process), but there are also cases where nonlinear absorption at high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a> is utilized, for example <a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">two-photon absorption</a> or even <a href="multiphoton_absorption.html" title="absorption processes where multiple photons are absorbed simultaneously">multiphoton absorption</a>, i.e., with two or more photons per excitation process.
The absorption causes the excitation of atoms, ions or molecules to certain excited electronic states.
Frequently, the excited objects first undergo some non-radiative transitions to lower excited states (see Figure&nbsp;1).
Finally, with some probability there will be emission of a photon from the excited state either to the electronic ground state or to another excited state, in the latter case with a correspondingly reduced photon energy and possibly followed by the emission of one or more additional photons.
There are also cases with <em>resonance fluorescence</em>, which do not involve additional electronic transitions, and the emission wavelengths are close to the excitation wavelength.
Part of the fluorescence may be <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenched</a>.</p>
<p>In free molecules, for example in gas spectroscopy, the involved excited states can involve vibrational and rotational states.
In case of solid materials, interactions with neighbored atoms can substantially modify the produced fluorescence.
Similarly, there are solvent interactions in liquids.</p>

Setup of a fluorescent spectrometer (spectrofluorometer) with a pulsed laser, monochromator and fast photodetector. Other setups may contain a broadband light source and an excitation monochromator or another kind of detector, for example a spectrograph with a multichannel detector.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some kind of samples contain natural kinds of fluorophores, which can be parts of certain larger molecules or separate fluorescent molecules.
For example, tyrosine and tryptophan occur in biological samples.
In other cases, one adds a fluorophore in the form of some fluorescent dye (frequently aromatic compounds such as fluorescein), which can help to reveal certain properties of the sample.
For example, certain dyes preferentially get attached to certain structures and can therefore act as markers for those.
Such methods are particularly used in <a href="fluorescence_microscopy.html" title="a technique for acquiring microscopic images using fluorescence which is excited in the sample">fluorescence microscopy</a> e.g. for biological research, where certain structures within biological cells can be marked.</p>
<p>In most cases, the excitation wavelength (or a broadband excitation spectrum) stays fixed.
However, there are also methods where one scans the excitation wavelength through a certain range and sometimes detects only the overall optical power of the fluorescence (without spectral analysis).
One then focuses on the details of the excitation mechanism rather than on the details of light emission.
Maximum flexibility is obtained when combining a variable excitation wavelength with full spectral analysis of the fluorescence.</p>
<p>The excitation light can be a <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> source or a <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulsed</a> source:</p>
<ul>
<li>For continuous excitation, one may analyze the fluorescence light mostly concerning its <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>, and sometimes also concerning the <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a>.</li>
<li>For pulsed excitation, one can also measure the fluorescence lifetime (decay time) &ndash; either of the complete light or of specific spectral components.
The fluorescence lifetime (e.g. in the nanosecond or microsecond region) can convey additional spectroscopic information.
For example, fluorescence of certain ions in a solid may be <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenched</a> when they are close to certain crystal defects or impurities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instruments for fluorescence spectroscopy can be called <em>spectrofluorometers</em>.
(There are also simpler <em>fluorometers</em> or <em>fluorimeters</em> without spectral resolution.)
Apart from high-performance instruments for use in laboratories, there are also more compact ones, even in the form of handheld battery-powered devices.</p>
<p>The excitation and/or the light detection may be restricted to a small volume on the sample.
Fluorescence spectroscopy measured with a high spatial resolution can be called <a href="fluorescence_microscopy.html" title="a technique for acquiring microscopic images using fluorescence which is excited in the sample">fluorescence microscopy</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Light Sources for Fluorescence Spectroscopy</h2>
<div>
<p>Depending on the chosen method, different kinds of light sources can be used for fluorescence spectroscopy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple light sources such as certain <a href="gas_discharge_lamps.html" title="light sources which are based on an electrical discharge in an ionized gas or metal vapor">gas discharge lamps</a> (e.g. <a href="mercury_vapor_lamps.html" title="metal vapor lamps based on light emission from mercury (Hg) atoms">mercury vapor lamps</a>) can be used for generating <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>, either with continuous or pulsed emission.
One then often requires some kind of optical bandpass filter for restricting the spectral range.
There are also sources with an <em>excitation monochromator</em> with which one scans through a certain range during the measurements.</li>
<li>In some cases, even <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light emitting diodes</a> (LEDs) are sufficient.
That allows for cheap and compact solutions, particularly for portable instruments.</li>
<li><a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">Lasers</a> of different kinds are particularly powerful excitation sources, since one can address a wide spectral range, including the ultraviolet, which is then usually generated with <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a> in a <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal</a>.
It may be of interest to do the excitation with light having a narrow optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> (<a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a>).
Further, with <a href="pulsed_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting light in the form of pulses">pulsed lasers</a> one can easily obtain short <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a> with <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">durations</a> of a few nanoseconds, or even <a href="picosecond_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting pulses with picosecond durations">picoseconds</a> or <a href="femtosecond_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting light pulses with durations between a few femtoseconds and hundreds of femtoseconds">femtoseconds</a>.</li>
<li>For excitation with widely variable wavelengths, one may use <a href="tunable_lasers.html" title="lasers the output wavelengths of which can be tuned">tunable lasers</a> or <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillators</a> (OPOs), or a broadband source in conjunction with an excitation monochromator as mentioned above.
In the latter case, the available excitation intensities are of course far smaller than with lasers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the used light source cannot produce light with a precisely constant <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> or <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a>, one may also measure its output with an additional photodetector and use its output signal to eliminate power fluctuations from the results of the fluorescence measurements.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Photodetectors</h2>
<div>
<p>Different kinds of photodetectors can be used, depending on the requirements.
For instruments with continuous-wave excitation and a scanning monochromator, one simply requires a photodetector with high <a href="sensitivity.html" title="(different meanings, depending on the context)">sensitivity</a> in the relevant spectral range &ndash; for example, some type of <a href="photodiodes.html" title="semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a>.
In conjunction with a dual monochromator for optimum suppression of stray light, one requires a tentatively even higher detector sensitivity.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to use a kind of <a href="spectrographs.html" title="instruments for spectrally analyzing light">spectrograph</a> containing a <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction grating</a> and a linear <a href="photodiode_arrays.html" title="typically linear arrays of photodiodes, provided as compact devices">photodiode array</a> or other kind of photodetector with spatial resolution.
When using a two-dimensional sensor, such as otherwise used as an <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensor</a>, one may achieve one-dimensional spatial resolution in combination with spectral resolution.</p>
<p>For fluorescence lifetime measurements, one requires a fast response (high bandwidth) in addition to the high sensitivity.
This narrows the choice of suitable detectors; one often uses <a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultipliers</a> or <a href="avalanche_photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes with internal signal amplification through an avalanche process">avalanche photodiodes</a>.
There are also devices containing a <a href="microchannel_plates.html" title="electron amplifiers with many spatial channels">microchannel plate</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Various Issues</h2>
<div>
<p>One typically tries to eliminate any direct effect of excitation light on the detector, e.g. by spectral discrimination, possibly also with other methods, e.g. by detection in a direction where little excitation light is expected, e.g. perpendicular to an excitation beam in a transparent sample.
Particularly in cases where the fluorescence is much weaker than the excitation light, or when the sample is strongly scattering the excitation light, strong suppression of excitation light in the detection system is required.
For example, one may need to use a double <a href="monochromators.html" title="optical devices which transmit only light in an adjustable small range of optical wavelengths">monochromator</a>.</p>
<p>For efficient light collection from the sample e.g. to the input <a href="optical_slits.html" title="narrow openings through which light can be transmitted">slit</a> of a monochromator, one can use a <a href="cylindrical_lenses.html" title="lenses which focus or defocus light only in one direction">cylindrical lens</a>.</p>
<p>The obtained fluorescence spectra may be modified by further interactions within the sample, for example by wavelength-dependent <a href="absorption.html" title="a process where light energy is converted to another form of energy">absorption</a>.
Such effects can be minimized by using thin samples.</p>
<p>In addition to fluorescence light, there may also be light arising from <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a>, which also exhibits some <a href="stokes_shift.html" title="the reduction in photon energy in certain processes">Stokes shift</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, the ultraviolet excitation light causes degradation (e.g. by photodecomposition) of the sample.
Highly sensitive detection is then particularly desirable, since it allows one to reduce the exposure time.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one needs to monitor not only the amount of fluorescence from a certain fluorophore, but precisely detect minor changes of the emission spectrum, for example due to subtle interactions in the sample.
A particularly high spectral resolution and low detection noise may be required in such cases.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>Fluorescence spectroscopy is often used in chemistry, biology and environmental monitoring.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industrial products, for example in the petroleum industry, or pharmaceutical products can be monitored with detection of fluorescence, for example in order to detect impurities.
One may identify substances and measure their concentrations.</li>
<li>Similar applications are in environment monitoring, e.g. on water samples or in air.</li>
<li>Various bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, causing dangerous infections, can be detected and distinguished through fluorescence spectroscopy.
Also, biomedical research on antibiotic sensitivity of microorganisms can profit from such methods.</li>
<li>Another application is cancer diagnostics in human tissues.
For example, one may infiltrate a sample with a substance which is preferentially accumulated in tumors and can then be detected through laser-induced fluorescence.</li>
<li>As already mentioned above, fluorescence markers are widely used in fluorescence microscopy for biological research.</li>
</ul>
<p>Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to gain substantial additional information and is thus interesting for certain areas of fundamental scientific research.</p>

The pulse picker can reduce the repetition rate to secure enough time for the photo-excited materials to reach their ground state before the next photoexcitation-fluorescence cycle is initiated.</p></aside>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="./spotlight_2014_12_17.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
</ul>
