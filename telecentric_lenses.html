<p>Various types of <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objectives</a>, as used for optical instruments like <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescopes</a>, <a href="photographic_objectives.html" title="objective lenses used for photography">photographic objectives</a> and <a href="laser_scanners.html" title="devices for scanning the direction of a laser beam">laser scanners</a>, are available with telecentric designs.
Telecentricity of an objective essentially means having a orthographic perspective like for an observer at infinite distance.
That implies that the chief rays are horizontal left and right of the optical system, and the <a href="entrance_and_exit_pupil.html" title="the apparent apertures of an optical system, seen from the object or image side">entrance or exit pupil</a> lies at infinity.
Telecentricity is achieved by utilizing an appropriately placed <a href="optical_apertures.html" title="structures which limit the propagation of light">optical aperture</a>, e.g. a <a href="diaphragms.html" title="circular (or approximately circular) openings through which light can travel">diaphragm</a>.
In some cases, that is not even required due to the already given restrictions to incoming beams.</p>
<p>One distinguishes between telecentricity on the object and image side, or on both sides; those cases are explained in the following section.</p>
<p>In practice, the telecentric condition (e.g. formulated via horizontal chief rays) is never perfectly fulfilled.
Telecentric objectives may therefore have an additional specification concerning the <em>telecentric angle</em>, which tells the deviation from perfect telecentricity.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Object-space Telecentric Lenses</h2>
<div>
<p>A lens or <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objective</a> can be made telecentric for the <a href="object_and_image_space.html" title="mathematical spaces for the description of optical elements and systems">object space</a> by inserting a stop (aperture) in the back <a href="focal_points_and_focal_planes.html" title="points to which parallel input rays are concentrated by an optical system, and the planes going through those points">focal plane</a>, as shown in Figure&nbsp;1 for a simple configuration with a single lens.
(The same principle can easily be applied to an <a href="objectives.html" title="optical elements for collecting light from inspected objects, or for sending light to objects">objective</a> consisting of multiple lenses &ndash; it also has a back focal plane.)
Only some of the rays, shown in blue color, can get through the stop and contribute to the image.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/object_telecentricity3.png" alt="object-space telecentricity">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Rays coming from an object in the focused plane partially get through the stop and meet in the image plane.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We now consider an image at a closer distance (see Figure&nbsp;2), which is observed <em>without</em> adjusting the focus.
Here, the transmitted rays do no longer meet on the original <a href="image_planes.html" title="planes which are conjugate to an object plane, so that objects are imaged there">image plane</a>; if the <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensor</a> stays at the original plane, the image will be somewhat blurred.
However, the center of the blurred region stays the same as before.
This is because the stop selects only those rays which are approximately horizontal before the lens.
Under such conditions, the object position will only affect the sharpness of the image, but not the position; the blurring is symmetrical around the constant center.
Note, however, that this works only if the stop is placed in the focal plane of the lens.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/object_telecentricity4.png" alt="object-space telecentricity">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
For an object at a smaller distance, the image is out of focus. However, the blood spot remains centered at the same location. (The original object position is still marked, and we leave the position of the image sensor unchanged.)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<aside class="callout green">How can an aperture influence the image size?</aside>
<p>Although the stop could not affect the position of a true focus point as in Figure&nbsp;1, it can affect the size and center of the blurred region in the defocused situation.
The influence of an <a href="aperture_stops.html" title="apertures which limit the angular range of received input light of imaging systems">aperture stop</a> of a <a href="photographic_objectives.html" title="objective lenses used for photography">photographic objective</a> on the <a href="depth_of_field.html" title="the distance between the nearest and furthest objects that can be imaged with reasonably sharp focus for a given focus setting">depth of field</a> is explained in the same way.</p>
<aside class="callout red">If an object moves away from the objective, it does <em>not</em> appear smaller!</aside>
<p>If we define the <a href="magnification.html" title="the enlargements of images">magnification</a> via the size on the chosen image plane (independent of the true location of the image plane), the magnification turns out to be independent of the object distance.
If the object is moved closer to the lens or further away, one only loses image sharpness, but the apparent size remains unchanged.
The blur effect can be reduced (i.e., the depth of field is increased) by reducing the aperture diameter; that would only reduce the image brightness.</p>
<p>Note that the magnification would of course change if the focus adjustment of the objective is modified.
One will thus usually not use such a lens with an autofocus device.</p>
<p>The <a href="entrance_and_exit_pupil.html" title="the apparent apertures of an optical system, seen from the object or image side">entrance pupil</a> of the objective is obtained by imaging the stop to the left side.
As the stop is in the focal plane, the entrance pupil is at infinity.
That again underlines the obtained orthographic perspective: it is as for an observer at infinite distance, where changes of the longitudinal object position do not matter.</p>
<p>In contrast, most other (non-telecentric) lenses or objectives (just like human eyes) have their entrance pupil closer to the center of the optical entrance, and thus see objects like from a reference point in that plane (<em>entocentric perspective</em>).
The result is that more distant objects are appearing smaller than closer ones.
Also, a small near object may fully cover a larger, but more distant object.
All that is different for a telecentric system.</p>
<p>The explained operation principle implies some limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires that the image plane has some distance from the stop.
Therefore, the device must not be focused to infinity, but to a closer plane.
One can therefore not get a large <a href="depth_of_field.html" title="the distance between the nearest and furthest objects that can be imaged with reasonably sharp focus for a given focus setting">depth of field</a> by using the <a href="hyperfocal_distance.html" title="the smallest focusing distance of an imaging instruments for which objects at infinity appear with reasonably sharp focus">hyperfocal distance</a>; instead, one must limit the aperture size.</li>
<li>The <a href="field_of_view.html" title="the angular extent of the field which can be observed with an optical instruments or the eye">field of view</a> &ndash; he are not defined as an angular range, but in terms of distances &ndash; is at most as large as the entrance diameter of the objective.
Therefore, object-space telecentric objectives often have to be made relatively large and are correspondingly heavy and expensive.
For the <a href="photo_cameras.html" title="optical instruments for taking photographic images">photography</a> of larger objects, telecentric objectives are normally not usable &ndash; except with particularly large versions, which can be realized with a <a href="fresnel_lenses.html" title="lenses where the surface profile has annular steps">Fresnel lens</a> at the input.</li>
</ul>
<p>An important field of application of object-space telecentric objectives is machine vision, where the orthographic perspective (with low distortion and no parallax error) can greatly simplify the imaging processing.
There are also telecentric measurement <a href="telescopes.html" title="optical instruments for viewing distant objects, or sometimes more generally afocal systems">telescopes</a>, allowing the measurement of true object sizes with no substantial sensitivity to their distance.</p>
<p>Some telecentric lenses contain additional devices for coaxial illumination.
Essentially, that means that <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated</a> light is sent through the optics towards the imaged object.
In other cases, one uses <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="laser beams with weak divergence">collimated</a> light coming from the opposite direction, i.e., towards the imaging system, when investigating transparent objects (e.g. for inspection of <a href="optical_glasses.html" title="glasses of high quality, made for optical applications">optical glasses</a>).
Note that the camera will then not image the light source; instead, the light source simply leads to homogeneous illumination of the image plane.</p>
<p>With such kinds of directed illumination, which is also sometimes called <em>telecentric illumination</em>, most accurate telecentric imaging is possible, when it comes to precisely capturing edges and surface structures.
The exposure time can then be relatively small, since most input light comes in a direction which can be used by the camera.</p>
<p>Note that telecentric illumination does not necessarily require a telecentric lens; a collimated beam is obtained simply by using a rather small light source (e.g. a small <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light emitting diode</a>) and a collimation lens.</p>
<p><a href="microscope_objectives.html" title="the optical component of a microscope which is next to the observed object">Microscope objectives</a> are also sometimes made object-space telecentric.
That avoids the apparent sizes changes of out-of-focus planes in thick specimens.
Besides, there are <a href="optical_profilometers.html" title="optical non-contact instruments for precisely measuring surface profiles">optical profilometers</a> with telecentric optics.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Image-space Telecentric Lenses</h2>
<div>
<p>Telecentricity can also be implemented <em>in</em> <em>image space</em> by placing an appropriate aperture in the <em>front focal plane</em>.
This is shown in Figure&nbsp;2, again with a simplified setup containing a single lens.
Due to the introduced stop, the light rays are essentially horizontal after the lens, if the aperture opening is small.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/image_telecentricity3.png" alt="image space telecentricity">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Rays from a certain object direction can partially pass the stop in the front focal plane, and after the lens they are nearly parallel. The vertical position in the image plane would not be changed if the image plane is somewhat shifted to the left or right; one would only get a slightly defocused image.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In effect, the vertical position of the image point is independent of the chosen position of an <a href="image_sensors.html" title="optoelectronic sensors which can be used for imaging">image sensor</a>; it is only that the image point will be somewhat blurred if the sensor is outside the focus.
The <a href="depth_of_focus.html" title="the half width of the range of longitudinal positions in which a reasonable focus for a film or image sensor is achieved">depth of focus</a> can of course be increased simply by reducing the stop diameter, which however causes a loss of image brightness.</p>
<p>For Figure&nbsp;2, parallel input rays from a distant object have been assumed, but the configuration would work in the same way for closer objects, only with the focus position somewhat shifted to the right.</p>
<p>For an application, the essential point may not be that the image size is independent of the sensor position, but rather that the light is always reaching the sensor with approximately normal incidence &ndash; not only in the center, but also in the peripheral regions.
That is important particularly for image sensors containing <a href="microlenses.html" title="optical lenses of particularly small diameter, e.g. below 1 mm">microlens</a> arrays.
Therefore, image-space telecentric objectives are often used in digital cameras.</p>
<p>Another application of telecentric optics are <a href="scanning_lenses.html" title="lens systems which are designed for use in laser scanners">scanning lenses</a> for <a href="laser_scanners.html" title="devices for scanning the direction of a laser beam">laser scanners</a>.
Telecentric scanning lenses can send a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> to different spots on a target surface, but each time with the approximately same direction of propagation.
Here, one usually does not have to use a diaphragm; the entrance stop is effectively created by the scanning apparatus, e.g. a polygon mirror wheel or an <a href="acousto_optic_deflectors.html" title="acousto-optic devices for deflecting and scanning laser beams">acousto-optic deflector</a>.
Such scanning applications include laser material processing, including special areas like microlithography.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Bi-telecentric Systems</h2>
<div>
<p>One can also make <em>bi-telecentric systems</em> (or <em>double-telecentric systems</em>), which means telecentricity in both object and image space.
That, however, is possible only with <a href="afocal_optical_systems.html" title="optical systems which output parallel rays for parallel input rays">afocal optical systems</a>.
Figure&nbsp;3 shows an example.
The chief ray (going through the center of the stop) is horizontal left of the first lens and right of the second lens.
Note that this can work only if the distance between the lenses is the sum of their focal lengths.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/double_telecentricity3.png" alt="double telecentricity">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
An afocal system which is made double telecentric with a stop, which is placed in the back focal plane of the first lens and in the front focal plane of the second lens.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bi-telecentric imaging systems may be used e.g. where one requires both a orthographic perspective and nearly normal incidence of light on an image sensor.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Telecentric Zoom Lenses</h2>
<div>
<p>Most telecentric lenses have a fixed <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a> and <a href="magnification.html" title="the enlargements of images">magnification</a>.
However, there are also telecentric zoom lenses, where the focal length and thus also the field of view and the magnification is adjustable in some range.
In order to maintain telecentricity, the zooming mechanism does not only have to adjust the focal length, but also keep the stop in the focal plane.
In some cases, the telecentric condition cannot be maintained over the full zoom range.</p>
