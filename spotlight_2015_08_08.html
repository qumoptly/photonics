<p>Abstract: This article discusses how the gain of the laser gain medium is saturated by short or ultrashort pulses. This is relevant for pulsed amplifiers and Q-switched lasers, for example.</p>
</div>
<figure class="right" style="width:130px;">

</figure>
<p>It is well-known that the <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">saturation</a> of the optical <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> of a laser <a href="optical_amplifiers.html" title="devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a> operated with constant pump and signal input power can be described with a formula like <span class="eqn_il"><i>g</i>(<i>P</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>)&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>g</i><sub>0</sub>&thinsp;/&thinsp;(1&thinsp;+&thinsp;<i>P</i><sub>s</sub>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>P</i><sub>sat</sub>)</span>, where <span class="eqn_il"><i>g</i><sub>0</sub></span> is the small-signal gain, <span class="eqn_il"><i>P</i><sub>s</sub></span> is the signal input power and <span class="eqn_il"><i>P</i><sub>sat</sub></span> is the <a href="saturation_power.html" title="a measure of the incident optical power required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation power</a>.
(The gain should be small, as otherwise the signal power rises within the gain medium; otherwise, one may have to numerically split the gain medium into several sections.)
What, however, happens when we apply a short signal <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulse</a>?
That question is relevant in many important cases, for example involving pulsed amplifiers and <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Calculating Gain Saturation</h2>
<div>
<p>Some people believe that saturation of a laser amplifier becomes substantial once the power of a signal pulse approximately reaches the level of the saturation power.
That guess can be quite wrong, however.
The formula given above applies only in the steady state, and that is typically reached after a few times the <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a> of the laser medium.
For most <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state laser gain media</a>, the upper-state lifetime is well above 1&nbsp;&mu;s, so that a nanosecond or even picosecond pulse is by far not long enough to bring the gain medium to its steady state.</p>
<p>For pulse durations far below the upper-state lifetime, it is quite clear that <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> has a negligible impact on the upper state population during the time of such a pulse.
Therefore, the value of the upper-state lifetime cannot be relevant for the saturation behavior, and the same holds for the saturation power, which depends on the upper-state lifetime.
What is relevant here is the <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation energy</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>E</i><sub>sat</sub></span>, which is essentially determined by the <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">emission cross section</a> at the signal wavelength and is not influenced by the upper-state lifetime.
(For example, it is not affected by <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> processes reducing that lifetime.)
Again, a simple formula can be used to calculate the gain after the pulse: <span class="eqn_il"><i>g</i><sub>f</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>g</i><sub>i</sub>&thinsp;exp(&minus;<i>E</i><sub>s</sub>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>E</i><sub>sat</sub>)</span>, where <span class="eqn_il"><i>g</i><sub>i</sub></span> is the initial gain and <span class="eqn_il"><i>E</i><sub>s</sub></span> is the signal pulse energy.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Example: Saturation in a Q-switched Laser</h2>
<div>
<p>When the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> of a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state laser</a> is switched to its high-<a href="q_factor.html" title="a measure of the damping of resonator modes">Q</a> state, the signal power rises rapidly, starting from a very low level.
When it reaches the saturation power, gain saturation still stays very weak, as explained above.
Only once the temporally integrated laser power reaches the order of the saturation energy, gain saturation sets in.
Therefore, the <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> occurring within such a laser (and also the output peak power) can be orders of magnitude above the saturation power of the gain medium.
(For a <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> output power, that is usually impossible.)</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Gain Saturation Caused by an Ultrashort Pulse</h2>
<div>
<p>A difficult issue arises when we want to calculate the saturation of a laser gain medium in an <a href="ultrafast_amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers for ultrashort (femtosecond or picosecond) optical pulses">ultrafast amplifier</a> caused by an optical pulse with a duration far below 1&nbsp;ps.
Such a pulse has a substantial optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> &ndash; at least the <a href="bandwidth_limited_pulses.html" title="pulses with a duration as short as possible with their optical spectrum">Fourier-limited bandwidth</a> or even more in case of <a href="chirp.html" title="time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirped pulses</a>.
One would naturally describe the spectral properties in the frequency domain, but that is clearly unsuitable for calculating the time-dependent gain.
Obviously, neither the time domain nor the frequency domain is suitable for fully treating what happens here.</p>
<p>The interaction of single atoms or ions with pulsed light can be described with Bloch equations, which are differential equations in the time domain.
For a complicated ensemble of laser-active ions interacting with a host crystal, however, this approach is hardly applicable.
The first challenge which one meets here is that one will normally not get all the detailed data to describe the behavior of ions in such a situation.</p>
<p>How can one obtain at least approximate results?
As long as the pulse energy is well below the saturation energy, one can easily calculate the pulse amplification in the frequency domain.
The weak effect of gain saturation can be simulated afterwords by reducing the gain according to the amount of energy the pulse has extracted &ndash; which is simply the difference of output and input pulse energy, assuming that additional effects such as parasitic losses do not occur.</p>
<p>For the case that the pulse energy reaches or exceeds the level of the saturation energy, the described approach can be extended.
One may simulate the interaction of the pulse with the gain medium in multiple steps, where each time only a fraction of the gain is applied to the pulse, and afterwords the gain is reduced according to the extracted energy.
This is an approximate method, however, which cannot precisely describe the details of such an amplification process.</p>
