<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="laser_development.html" title="the process of developing a laser device">laser development</a> and <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a></p>
<p>It is a very common and often quite reasonable approach to solve problems e.g. in a development project step by step.
You don't try to fix everything in one go, but rather identify and solve one problem, then turn to the next one, etc.
This often works fine &ndash; except with lasers.</p>
<p>The problem with lasers is essentially that various physical aspects are coupled to each other in rather complicated ways, so that changing one aspect usually has multiple consequences &ndash; normally a desired one plus various side effects.
Obviously, a step-by-step approach must fail if on average each measure introduces at least one additional side effect&hellip;
Imagine a car which behaves like a laser.
You repair the left door and then find that this affected the gear.
There is a fix to the gear, but this causes the rear lamps to fall off.
As you reinstall those, the engine won't start.
Fortunately, cars normally don't behave like lasers.</p>
<p>Isn't that exaggerated, some readers may wonder.
Not that much, I claim.
To see this, let us consider a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a>.
For an illustration, distribute the following terms on a sheet of paper: <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>, pump intensity, <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a>, <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, <a href="threshold_pump_power.html" title="the pump power at which the laser threshold is reached">threshold pump power</a>, alignment sensitivity, <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a>, <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> in the laser crystal and <a href="q_switches.html" title="optical switches which are typically used for generating nanosecond pulses in lasers">Q switch</a>, <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, <a href="gain.html" title="a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, switching speed, <a href="laser_induced_breakdown.html" title="a kind of spark, initiated by intense laser light">laser-induced breakdown</a> on <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a>, pulse instabilities.
Now draw an arrow for each cause/effect relation, e.g. from <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a> to <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a>.
You will easily end up with a rather involved diagram, even though we consider only some selection of aspects and have dropped essential others.
It is easy to recognize that most changes to any aspect will have more than one effect on the overall performance, and it is unlikely that a step-by-step approach leads to a good result without taking many iterations.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are solutions.
While design iterations can hardly be avoided, except in trivial cases, there are different ways of testing, identifying and solving problems.
One key point is to do as many of the required iterations as possible on the desk, rather than in the lab.
This is much more efficient in terms of money and <a href="spotlight_2007_03_16.html">time</a>, because it is just too tedious and time-consuming to set up a laser according to a faulty design, to identify and correctly understand occurring problems, to implement changes, etc.
Ideally, such work is done by a <a href="paschotta.html">technical expert</a> who is familiar both with all essential aspects of <a href="laser_physics.html" title="the field of physics dealing with phenomena in lasers">laser physics</a> and with the typical trade-offs.
He knows from the beginning what to look for, and the first prototype will have good chances to work properly.</p>
