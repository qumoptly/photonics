<p>When a parameter of a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> (optical cavity) such as an arm length or the dioptric power (inverse <a href="focal_length.html" title="a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a>) of the focusing element in the resonator is varied, the resonator may go through one (for <a href="ring_lasers.html" title="lasers with a ring resonator">ring</a> resonators) or two (for <a href="standing_wave_resonators.html" title="optical resonators with two end mirrors">standing-wave resonators</a>) <em>stability zones</em>.</p>
<p>In a purely geometric analysis, stability means that a ray injected into the optical system will stay at a finite distance from the axis even after many round trips.
In this regime, the <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> (self-reproducing field configurations, calculated with <a href="wave_optics.html" title="the description of optical phenomena based on wave models">wave optics</a>) are of much simpler structure than for an <a href="unstable_resonators.html" title="optical resonators which are dynamically unstable with respect to transverse beam offsets">unstable resonator</a>.
The properties of the resonator modes can vary strongly within a stability zone and also between different zones.</p>

Here, the left zone is zone II according to Magni, and the right one is zone I.

<h2 class="togglediv">Properties of Stability Zones for Linear Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>The detailed properties of stability zones are very important for the issue of <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a>, in particular as a part of <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a>, because the properties of a laser resonator can be essential for laser performance.
Resonator stability zones have been explored in a huge volume of literature.
A paper by Magni [2] presented a detailed analysis for <a href="standing_wave_resonators.html" title="optical resonators with two end mirrors">linear resonators</a>.
Some important properties are discussed in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the edges of the stability zones of a linear resonator, the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radii</a> at the resonator end mirrors can either diverge or vanish.</li>
<li>In the case of a variable <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a>, such as the <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lens</a> in the laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>, the beam radius at the position of the variable lens goes through a minimum somewhere within a stability zone, and diverges at the stability edges.</li>
<li>Both stability zones of a linear resonator have the same minimum beam radius at the variable lens, but are very different in other respects.
In particular, one of the stability zones (called zone&nbsp;II according to Magni) has a stability edge where the mode sizes on both end mirrors diverge.
At this point, the <a href="alignment_sensitivity_of_optical_resonators.html" title="the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">alignment sensitivity</a> of the resonator also diverges, so that stable operation of a laser near such a point is difficult to achieve: not only mirror tilts, but also asymmetries of the thermal lens, as can occur during pump alignment, critically affect the transverse position of the laser mode.
The other stability zone, called zone&nbsp;I, does not exhibit such a divergence of alignment sensitivity, and is generally overall better than zone&nbsp;II in terms of stability.</li>
<li>The width of the stability zones in terms of focusing power of the variable lens is twice the <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> divided by <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&pi;</span></span> times the square of the minimum beam radius at the variable lens.
This means that resonators with a large minimum mode size inevitably have narrow stability regions.</li>
<li>Only one of the two stability zones of a linear resonator may be observed, e.g. when the variable lens is very close to one end mirror (shifting zone&nbsp;I into a regime with very strong focusing), or when both stability zones merge to form a single zone of twice the width.</li>
<li>In cases without circular symmetry around the beam axis, the stability zones for the horizontal and vertical direction can be different, and may not overlap.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Properties of Stability Zones for Ring Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>Similar to Ref. [2] for linear resonators, Ref. [3] presented an analysis for <a href="ring_resonators.html" title="optical resonators where light can independently circulate in two different directions">ring resonators</a>.
These have somewhat simpler properties, which however are similar to those of linear resonators in many respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ring resonators have only a single stability zone.</li>
<li class="ta_left">At both edges of the stability zone, the mode radii diverge.
However, only at one of the edges the <a href="alignment_sensitivity_of_optical_resonators.html" title="the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">alignment sensitivity</a> also diverges, whereas it reaches a minimum on the other stability edge.</li>
<li class="ta_left">The minimum mode size at the thermal lens again determines the width of the stability region in terms of dioptric power, but that width is twice as large as for a linear resonator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The differences to linear resonators are related to the fact that in a ring resonator the laser beam passes the thermal lens only once per round trip, instead of twice as in a linear resonator.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Consequences for Resonator Design</h2>
<div>
<p>Some of the consequences of such properties for the <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">design</a> of <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonators</a> (particularly for <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>) are shortly discussed in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting very high optical powers">High-power</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> are often designed with a relatively small minimum mode size in the gain medium, because otherwise the stability zones would be too narrow, and the laser could be operated only in a narrow range of pump powers.
A consequence of that, however, is that the laser will oscillate on multiple transverse <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> and thus not generate a <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> output beam.</li>
<li>For stable operation of a laser with diffraction-limited output (high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>), it is often preferable to operate close to the point with minimum mode size in the gain medium, and of course to design the resonator such that this mode approximately matches the pump intensity distribution.
Such an operation point minimizes the sensitivity to small changes of the focusing power of the thermal lens.</li>
<li>It can also be preferable to operate a laser in stability zone&nbsp;I in order to minimize the alignment sensitivity.
There exists a systematic procedure to find a resonator design which operates at the beam radius minimum of the wanted stability zone, while meeting other requirements such as a suitable minimum mode size.</li>
</ul>
