</header>
<p>In various situations, it is desirable to modify the shape of optical <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a> with some kind of <em>pulse shaper</em>.
In particular, this occurs in the context of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>, and this article concentrates on that domain, with <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a> in the picosecond or femtosecond region.
Such light pulses are usually generated with <a href="picosecond_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting pulses with picosecond durations">picosecond lasers</a> or <a href="femtosecond_lasers.html" title="lasers emitting light pulses with durations between a few femtoseconds and hundreds of femtoseconds">femtosecond lasers</a> of various kinds.</p>
<p>Pulse shaping often concerns the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> versus time, but it can also involve the time-dependent <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a> or the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>.
Different kinds of pulse shapes may be required, depending on the application.
For example, one may simply obtained a flat <a href="spectral_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field in the frequency domain">spectral phase</a>.
A more complicated case is the generation of a certain predefined temporal evolution of the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a>.
In some cases, quite complex pulse shapes are formed &ndash; not just simple shapes like <a href="gaussian_pulses.html" title="pulses with a temporal intensity profile which has a Gaussian shape">Gaussian</a>, <a href="sech2_shaped_pulses.html" title="pulses with a temporal intensity profile which has the shape of a sech<sup>2</sup> function">sech<sup>2</sup></a> or <a href="parabolic_pulses.html" title="pulses with a parabolic intensity profile">parabolic</a> ones, but pulses with strong and complicated modulations of optical power and <a href="optical_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a>.</p>
<p>Very different physical principles of pulse shaping can be applied, and the most important ones of those are explained in the following sections.</p>
<p>Special cases of pulse shaping are <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compression</a> and <a href="pulse_stretchers.html" title="devices for temporally stretching ultrashort light pulses">pulse stretching</a>, where the modification of the <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> is of primary interest, and usually not the detailed temporal or spectral shape.</p>
<p>This article does not deal with the shaping of electrical pulses, as is often applied for example in the context of signal processing.
Also, the article does not treat pulse shaping effects within <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>, but only pulse shaping applied to pulses after their generation.
Besides, it does not treat nonlinear pulse shaping devices such as <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorbers</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Methods of Pulse Shaping</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Direct Temporal Shaping</h3>
<div>
<p>In principle, on could directly manipulate pulse shapes with some kind of <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulator</a>.
However, even the fastest available modulators are at most fast enough for very coarse temporal shaping of relatively long picosecond pulses.
Therefore, completely different methods, as described in the following sections are usually applied.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Dispersive Pulse Shaping</h3>
<div>
<p>The temporal shape of a light pulse may be modified by applying <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>.
In a simplified physical picture, this means that the relative arrival times of different <a href="wavelength.html" title="the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> components of pulses are manipulated through the wavelength-dependent <a href="group_delay.html" title="a measure of the time delay experienced by narrow-band light pulses in an optical device">group delay</a> in the pulse shaper.</p>
<p>In simple cases, one applies chromatic dispersion with a fixed spectral profile.
For example, the dispersion profile of a <a href="chirped_mirrors.html" title="Bragg-type dispersive mirrors with a spatial variation of the Bragg wavelength">chirped mirror</a>, a <a href="volume_bragg_gratings.html" title="Bragg gratings written into some bulk material">volume Bragg grating</a> or a <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg grating</a> can be optimized for a specific pulse shaping purpose.</p>
<p>In other cases, variable (adjustable or programmable) pulse shaping is required.
That can be realized with different techniques.
Usually, one employs some kind of Fourier synthesis methods (also called <em>Fourier transform pulse shaping</em>), where one somehow manipulates the amplitude and/or the phase of many different spectral components such that the desired temporal pulse shape is obtained.
Such approaches generally do not require extremely fast modulators and the like, but instead the spatial or temporal separation of different wavelength components.</p>
<p>A typical technique is to spatially separate the wavelength components with a <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction grating</a>, then to make them propagate on parallel paths with a <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a>, then send the light through a spatial light modulator (e.g. a nematic <a href="liquid_crystal_modulators.html" title="optical modulators which are based on liquid crystals">liquid crystal modulator</a>) and finally spatially recombine the wavelength components with additional optical elements or with the same ones as used for accomplishing the spatial separation.
Figure&nbsp;1 shows a typical kind of optical setup.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/pulse_shaper_with_slm.png" alt="pulse shaper with spatial light modulator">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Optical setup of an ultrafast pulse shaper based on diffraction gratings, lenses and a spatial light modulator. Different wavelengths components (of which only three are shown) are spatially separated in the device but recombined in the end.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<aside class="callout blue">One may control the spectral amplitudes or phases, or both.</aside>
<p>Each element of the spatial light modulator may e.g. act as a <a href="phase_modulators.html" title="devices for manipulating the phase of a laser beam">phase modulator</a> for a small spectral range.
With other modulators, one can also adjust the spectral amplitude, or both amplitude and phase, and sometimes the <a href="polarization_of_light.html" title="direction of the electric field oscillation of a light beam">polarization</a>.
Phase-only modulators are often used, and although they do not provide complete freedom for pulse shaping, this approach is sufficient in many cases, since the <a href="spectral_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field in the frequency domain">spectral phase</a> is of primary importance.</p>
<p>Typically, the spatial light modulator will have a number of channels of the order of 1000.
That means that around 1000 spectral features can be controlled independently.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="chromatic_aberrations.html" title="image distortions caused by wavelength-dependent optical effects">chromatic aberrations</a> of lenses can lead to non-perfect recombination of the different wavelength components, and thus to complicated spatio-temporal effects.
In that respect, setups with curved mirrors are superior, because they do not exhibit chromatic dispersion.</p>
<p>Generally, the optical alignment of such ultrafast pulse shapers is quite critical.
If the different wavelengths components are not perfectly recombined in space after the device, unwanted spatio-temporal effects can arise.
Effectively, one then obtains different temporal pulse shapes at different locations.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="diffraction.html" title="wave phenomena which occur when light waves hit some structure with variable transmission or phase changes">diffraction</a> at the light modulator, depending on the programed modulation pattern, prohibits perfect collection of all light into a single output beam.
Nevertheless, the technique can be used for generating arbitrary phase and amplitude profiles within the limitations which are essentially given by the spectral range and resolution, as explained in the following.</p>
<aside class="callout green">What spectral range and resolution is required?</aside>
<p>The obtained temporal resolution is limited not by the spectral resolution, but by the width of the covered spectral range.
On the other hand, the spectral resolution determines the temporal range which the shaped pulses can span.
For example, a <a href="double_pulses.html" title="two closely spaced optical pulses">double pulse</a> with large temporal separation has a rapidly modulated optical spectrum.</p>
<p>Fourier transform pulse shapers are tentatively easier to realize for femtosecond pulses than for picosecond pulses, since the larger <a href="bandwidth.html" title="the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of shorter pulses makes it easier to spatially separate spectral components.</p>
<p>Note that a rather slow kind of spatial amplitude modulator can be used; it is in fact common to use <a href="liquid_crystal_modulators.html" title="optical modulators which are based on liquid crystals">liquid crystal modulators</a>.
Their limited speed only implies that the details of the pulse shaping cannot be rapidly modified.
The maximum pattern update rate is of the order of 100&nbsp;Hz.
It is no problem, however, to shape pulse trains with very high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a>, if it is acceptable that not every pulse can be shaped individually.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Pulse Shaping with Deformable or Moving Mirrors</h3>
<div>
<p>Instead of a liquid crystal modulator, one may use a <a href="deformable_mirrors.html" title="mirrors which can be deformed in a controlled manner, e.g. for wavefront correction in adaptive optics">deformable mirror</a>, as otherwise used in adaptive optics, for example.
When different wavelength components hit different positions on the mirror, their optical phase can be controlled independently if the elevation of those points can be controlled independently.
Instead of a deformable mirror, one may also use an array of small movable mirrors.
Normally, the number of independently controllable spectral features is substantially smaller than achievable either with liquid crystal modulators or with acoustical-optic devices as described below.</p>
<p>A particularly simple version uses one flat mirror, which is only tilted, instead of the deformable mirror.
Tilting produces only a linear spectral phase, which results in a temporal shift.
The device is then actually not a true pulse shaper, but only a pulse shifter.
In comparison with other types of <a href="optical_delay_lines.html" title="an optical setup which is used to introduce a time delay for a light beam">optical delay lines</a>, however, the modulation frequencies can be substantially higher.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Acousto-optic Pulse Shaping</h3>
<div>
<p>There are different kinds of acousto-optic pulse shapers.
One of them is quite similar to the Fourier transform pulse shapers explained above; essentially, one uses an <a href="acousto_optic_modulators.html" title="optical modulators based on the acousto-optic effect">acousto-optic modulator</a> as the spatial light modulator.
At the time with the optical pulses passes the modulator, it must contain an acoustic pattern with a spatial shape which leads to the wanted degree of diffraction for the different wavelength components.
For that purpose, the modulator is usually driven with a programmable RF function generator, also called <em>arbitrary waveform
generator</em> (AWG).</p>
<p>In comparison with the pulse shape as explained above, the following aspects are different with an acousto-optic modulator:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="insertion_loss.html" title="power losses due to insertion of a device">insertion loss</a> is significantly higher.</li>
<li>The modulation pattern can be updated much more quickly &ndash; for example, with an update rate of the order of 100&nbsp;kHz (or even more) instead of only 100&nbsp;Hz.
On the other hand, it is not possible to apply the shaping to pulse trains with high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a> as they are obtained from typical <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a> (e.g. 100&nbsp;MHz), since the generated acoustic pattern moves in the device with the velocity of sound.
For each optical pulse, one needs to prepare a well synchronized acoustic pulse.
The length of the device divided by the velocity of sound sets an upper limit for the inverse update rate.
Therefore, such pulse shapers are suitable for <a href="ultrafast_amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers for ultrashort (femtosecond or picosecond) optical pulses">ultrafast amplifier</a> systems, for example, where the pulse repetition rate is substantially reduced with a <a href="pulse_pickers.html" title="electrically controlled optical switches used for extracting single pulses from a pulse train">pulse picker</a>, but not directly for mode-locked lasers.</li>
<li>It is more difficult to handle very broadband pulses.
This is essentially because the deflection angle of the modulator introduces a substantial additional wavelength-dependent path length, i.e., chromatic dispersion; although that can in principle be compensated, it is difficult to do that without introducing higher-order chromatic dispersion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another kind of acousto-optic pulse shaper, which can be realized with a much simpler and more compact optical setup, is based on a kind of <a href="acousto_optic_tunable_filters.html" title="acousto-optic devices which can be used for filtering light, controlled with an RF input">acousto-optic tunable filter</a>, here called <em>acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter</em> (AOPDF).
In that device, the light pulse propagates collinearly with a sound wave, which is again controlled with a computer-controlled function generator connected to the piezo transducer of the modulator.
The interaction with the acoustic wave leads to a transfer of energy into a different polarization mode &ndash; for example, from ordinary to extraordinary polarization.
For one particular acoustic frequency, that <a href="phase_matching.html" title="a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase-matched</a> transfer works only in a limited range of <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequencies</a>.
With a suitable superposition of acoustic waves, one can control amplitude and phase of the whole optical output with extraordinary polarization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of Pulse Shapers</h2>
<div>
<p>The following sections give a few examples for applications of ultrafast pulse shapers.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Compensation of Dispersion and Nonlinearities in Amplifier Systems</h3>
<div>
<p>In an <a href="ultrafast_amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers for ultrashort (femtosecond or picosecond) optical pulses">ultrafast amplifier</a> system based on <a href="chirped_pulse_amplification.html" title="a technique for amplifying pulses to very high optical intensities while avoiding excessive nonlinear pulse distortions or optical damage">chirped pulse amplification</a> (CPA), it is essential to have a <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compressor</a> which quite precisely produces a flat <a href="spectral_phase.html" title="the phase of the electric field in the frequency domain">spectral phase</a> of the output, so that the maximum <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> and minimum <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> are obtained.
Due to various device tolerances, this is difficult to achieve in cases where a large amount of pulse stretching is required, for example due to the high <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a>.
It can then be convenient to have a programmable pulse shaper in addition to a fixed <a href="pulse_stretchers.html" title="devices for temporally stretching ultrashort light pulses">pulse stretcher</a>, with which the fine adjustment of the spectral phase can be done.
It is then also possible to compensate for additional nonlinear phase changes arising from the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr nonlinearity</a> of the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>.
That way, one may also be able to tolerate stronger nonlinear effects.</p>

<p><a href="dispersion_compensation.html" title="the control of the overall chromatic dispersion of a system by adding optical elements with a suitable amount of dispersion">Dispersion compensation</a> is also frequently required in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> systems.
Pulse shapers can provide flexibly adjustable dispersion compensation.
This could be particularly interesting for systems using <a href="time_division_multiplexing.html" title="a multiplexing technique operating in the time domain">time division multiplexing</a> at very high data rates.</p>
<p>Besides, it is possible to encode information on ultrashort light pulses through their spectrum &ndash; for example by imprinting a certain spectral phase, which also totally changes their temporal profile.
The full <a href="peak_power.html" title="maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> of the original pulse is retrieved by a second pulse shaper only if it basically compensates for the originally applied phase modulation.
This can be used in the context of <em>optical code division multiple access</em> (O-CDMA) systems.
Here, one uses multiple optical transmitters which use different phase encodings, and for each one a receiver which applies the opposite spectral phase changes, with which it can detect only the signals from the corresponding transmitter [3].</p>

<h3 class="togglediv">Control of Chemical Reactions</h3>
<div>
<p>It is well known that chemical reactions can be initiated by light which is used to excite atoms or molecules.
This does usually not lead to an exact control; different kinds of chemical reactions may be initiated at the same time.
However, in some situations it is possible to carefully control chemical reactions by using tailored femtosecond pulses from a computer-controlled pulse shaper [2].</p>
<p>Quite complex pulse shapes can be required, which may not even be known in at once; they are related to complicated quantum dynamics of molecules.
There are schemes for adaptive pulse shaping, where one uses a computer algorithm for optimizing the pulse shape such that one e.g. obtains a maximum amount of a certain reaction product.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Optical Coherence Tomography</h3>
<div>
<p>In some <a href="optical_coherence_tomography.html" title="an optical imaging technique where longitudinal resolution is achieved based on interference effects with low-coherence light">optical coherence tomography</a> systems, one requires very high scan rates.
A limiting factor can be the speed of an <a href="optical_delay_lines.html" title="an optical setup which is used to introduce a time delay for a light beam">optical delay line</a>.
Quite high speeds can be achieved with a pulse shaper including a tilted mirror, as explained above.
Note, however, that <a href="wavelength_swept_lasers.html" title="lasers which allow for period and fast wavelength tuning">wavelength-swept lasers</a> can enable far higher scan speeds.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Performance Checks with Pulse Characterization</h2>
<div>
<p>Various methods of <a href="pulse_characterization.html" title="the measurement of various properties of an optical pulse">pulse characterization</a> can be applied to monitor pulse shapes, e.g. before and after a pulse shaper in order to monitor the operation.
In particular, there are methods of <a href="frequency_resolved_optical_gating.html" title="a technique for the complete characterization of ultrashort optical pulses">frequency resolved optical gating</a> (FROG) and <a href="spectral_phase_interferometry.html" title="a class of interferometric methods for pulse characterization, where interference in the frequency domain is exploited">spectral phase interferometry</a> (SPIDER), apart from optical cross-correlators.</p>
