<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, <a href="quantum_defect.html" title="energy difference between pump and laser photons">quantum defect</a>, <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a>, <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a></p>
<p>While the general effect of heat dissipation in <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> is very well known, also its consequence of <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, many uncertainties exist concerning the details.
For example, is it more the pump intensity or also the laser intensity which determines the dissipated power density?
How does this depend on resonator losses?
And why do different crystals appear to behave differently in such respects?</p>
<p>In fact not only the details of the crystal are important, but also certain key parameters of the <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a>, such as the lasing wavelength, focusing conditions and resonator losses.
Without any lasing, even a perfect laser crystal, not exhibiting any parasitic processes such as <a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a>, would show some heating when being pumped.
The average number of <a href="photons.html" title="quanta of light energy">photons</a> absorbed and emitted by the laser-active ions within some time interval may not substantially increase when lasing occurs, unless the <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> efficiency of the crystal (not of single ions!) is significantly decreased without lasing (&rarr;&nbsp;saturation of pump absorption).
The dissipated heat per photon can be larger or smaller with lasing, depending on the deviation of the laser wavelength from the average wavelength of <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a>.
In this respect, some <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped gain media</a> show quite a different behavior from the usual <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG</a> or <a href="vanadate_lasers.html" title="lasers based on rare-earth-doped yttrium, gadolinium or lutetium vanadate crystals, usually Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>">vanadate lasers</a>.
While some lasers are in danger of having their crystal fractured when the resonator is blocked, the crystals of others become even cooler under such conditions.</p>
<p>Additional effects come into play via parasitic processes.
<a href="quenching.html" title="the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">Quenching</a> processes usually become stronger for higher upper-state populations and thus for higher <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> losses.
Therefore, some <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a> are plagued by much stronger <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> than the same lasers in <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a> (with the Q switch turned off).
How strong that effect is, depends on the crystal quality and particularly the <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a>, apart from design aspects as mentioned above.
Unfortunately, the reproducibility can suffer when the crystal quality varies; one may have to take into account such variations in the <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a>, which is possible by choosing appropriate parameters (e.g. for the required upper-level population) and also in the context of <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a>.</p>
<p>The complexity of such issues (or the absence of the related know-how) leads many to resign and just go for the trial-and-error approach.
This may not be very efficient, however.
Imagine for example the trouble which can occur when the results of the nicely tweaked prototype can not be reliably reproduced in production!
A proper <a href="laser_design.html" title="the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a> does not only lead to a prototype with satisfactory performance, but also minimizes the dependence on variable parameters.
Furthermore, a well done design will make it easier to understand and realize the potential for later improvements e.g. in terms of output power.</p>
<p>It is surprising indeed how many companies nevertheless stay with the muddle-through approach.
Maybe this happens because people don't even know about alternative approaches, or got frustrated when trying this with insufficient experience.</p>
