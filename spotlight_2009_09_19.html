<p class="ref">Ref.: R. Paschotta, &ldquo;Power scalability as a precise concept for the evaluation of laser architectures&rdquo; in <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/" rel="nofollow">arXiv.org</a>, see <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0711.3987" rel="nofollow">arXiv:0711.3987v1</a>; encyclopedia article on <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling of lasers</a></p>
<p>When <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling of lasers</a> is discussed in the scientific literature, this is usually done without caring what exactly the term &ldquo;power scaling&rdquo; should mean.
I criticized this before, and delivered a clear and meaningful definition in the open-access paper as referenced above.
I also demonstrated that a lot of useful thoughts arise when one uses the term with a well-defined meaning.</p>
<p>The issues considered in the context of power scaling of lasers are nearly always directly associated with the laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>.
It is clear why: this is the place where the biggest challenges have been encountered so far.
However, an interesting question is the following.
Assume we could find and realize a gain medium which is truly power-scalable, which means that there is a systematic scaling procedure for realizing any output power without increasing any of the challenges (such as thermal effects, optical damage, etc.).
Would that imply that we have power-scalable lasers?
Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is no, at least if we demand a high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> of the output.
And the reason for that is related to the properties of <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonators</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">A Scaling Procedure for Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>Well, <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonators</a> <em>are</em> scalable in a certain sense.
Start with a certain resonator design and apply the following procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase all arm lengths by some factor <span class="eqn_il"><i>s</i></span>.</li>
<li class="ta_left">Increase all curvature radii of mirrors by the same factor, also the focal lengths of any lenses and other (de)focusing elements, including the <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lens</a> of the gain medium.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, all <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radii</a> will increase by the square root of <span class="eqn_il"><i>s</i></span>, and the beam areas will <span class="eqn_il"><i>s</i></span> times higher than before, assuming that the optical wavelength stays unchanged.
The stability zones of the resonator in terms of thermal lensing will look the same as before, if the scaling of the <a href="dioptric_power.html" title="the inverse of the focal length">dioptric powers</a> is adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>So this procedure allows you to realize arbitrarily large mode areas.
In that way you can keep the optical intensities constant when going up with the output power by a factor <span class="eqn_il"><i>s</i><sup>2</sup></span>.
The gain medium must scale such that the dioptric power is reduced in proportion to <span class="eqn_il"><i>s</i><sup>&minus;1</sup></span>.
That condition is not unrealistic; for example, a <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk laser</a> head meets it as long as stress effects are negligible.</p>
<p>There are serious caveats, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>The resonator length will scale in proportion to the output power.
If 0.1&thinsp;m, for example, is a reasonable length for a 1-W laser, a 1-kW laser would need a 100&thinsp;m long resonator &ndash; not exactly convenient.
And if it is a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a>, the <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> will also scale in proportion to the power.</li>
<li>The alignment sensitivity of the resonator increases with the scaling.
Well, for larger beams we can tolerate accordingly larger beam offsets resulting from unwanted mirror misalignment.
However, it turns out that still the misalignment angles would have to scale in proportion to <span class="eqn_il"><i>s</i><sup>&minus;1</sup></span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">A Theoretical Solution: Wavelength Scaling</h2>
<div>
<p>Is there a way out?
Well, yes, but not a realistic one.
Instead of the procedure described above, keep all arm lengths, mirror curvatures and dioptric powers constant, but increase the wavelength of laser emission by a factor of <span class="eqn_il"><i>s</i><sup>2</sup></span>.
That will increase the mode areas by the same factor.
The alignment sensitivity even goes down, so we can tolerate angular errors of the mirrors which are larger by the factor <span class="eqn_il"><i>s</i></span>.</p>
<p>The obvious caveat here is that we can not simply scale the wavelength.
There are no wavelength-scalable gain media, and the applications can not live with arbitrarily long wavelengths.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Conclusions</h2>
<div>
<p>This analysis leads to important conclusions.
First of all, laser resonators are <em>not</em> power-scalable, at least if we do not allow to scale up the resonator length and scale down the alignment errors.
Somebody may object: I don't care, my main problems are not with the resonators, but with the gain media and <a href="laser_heads.html" title="assemblies containing a mounted gain medium and means for pumping and cooling, or the complete optical parts of a laser, or assemblies for directing a laser beam to a workpiece">laser heads</a>.
Well, that may be so for now.
However, if we look ahead, we find that we will face a problem with resonators even if we develop a truly power-scalable laser head.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize that the problems resulting from this issue are not something far away.
Actually, I hit them already when developing high-power laser resonators for some of my customers.
It happens that they want a resonator with a combination of nice features:</p>
<ul>
<li>large mode areas on all mirrors, in order not to kill these in Q-switched operation</li>
<li>limited resonator length for reasons of compactness and possibly also a short pulse duration</li>
<li>low alignment sensitivity</li>
</ul>
<p>I am perfectly equipped with <a href="resonator.html">resonator design software</a> which allows me to find the best possible solution, but there are hard physical limits which cannot be pushed away with software.
The best one can do in this situation is to develop a good understanding of the limitations.</p>
