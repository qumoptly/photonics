<h1>References</h1>
<p>The company RP Photonics Consulting GmbH, as well as its founder and executive <a href="paschotta.html">Dr. RÃ¼diger Paschotta</a>, can provide excellent references, because the orientation at <a href="standards.html">highest professional standards</a> is constant practice, not just nice words.
However, customers giving references can not be listed here, since by default RP Photonics treats as confidential even the fact of cooperation.</p>
<p>If some new customer requires some reference even after having studied <a href="CV_Paschotta.pdf">Dr. Paschotta's CV and publication list</a>, Dr. Paschotta will ask some client to give such a reference.</p>
