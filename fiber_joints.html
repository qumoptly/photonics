</header>
<p>In many applications of <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a>, it is necessary to connect fiber ends (terminations) in some way such that light from one fiber can get into the other fiber without losing too much of its <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
Examples are <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and systems for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>.</p>
<p>There are different techniques for joining fiber ends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent and stable connections with very low transition losses can be obtained by <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicing</a>.
Essentially, the <a href="fibers.html" title="a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> ends are fused together with a heat treatment.</li>
<li>Semi-permanent connections can be made with <a href="mechanical_fiber_splices.html" title="permanent or semi-permanent connections of optical fibers which are held in place with mechanical means">mechanical splices</a>, which are relatively simple alignment devices holding the fiber ends together.
Typically, some <a href="index_matching_fluids.html" title="fluids with a refractive index similar to that of other optical materials, typically used for suppressing light reflections">index matching gel</a> or an epoxy is used for reducing reflection losses.
Compared with fusion splices, mechanical splices are faster to make and can be removed after use.
The initial cost is much lower, but the cost per splice is higher.
The splice losses and reflection loss are of the order of 0.5&nbsp;dB, i.e., significantly higher than for fusion splices.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">Fiber connectors</a> are convenient for connections which need to be released more often.
Common connector types are named FC, SC and LC for single-mode applications and ST for multimode, but there are also dozens of other types, with special qualities such as duplex connections, particularly small size, built-in shutter for improved <a href="laser_safety.html" title="safety of the use of laser devices">laser safety</a>, etc.
In most cases, the fiber is glued into the connector with some epoxy, and then the fiber end is polished.
The transition losses of connectors are similar to those of mechanical splices, although the stability is generally lower.</li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, it is essential that the fiber ends are carefully prepared before joining them.
In many cases, fiber ends with perpendicularly cut surfaces are needed.
This has the advantage that the axis of the emitted light is in line with the fiber axis, and the alignment is comparatively simple.
In other cases, the <a href="cleaving_of_fibers.html" title="preparing fiber ends with clean optical surfaces by controlled breaking">cleave</a> angle has to have some deviation from 90&deg;.
Such angle cleaves have the advantage that light reflected at the air&ndash;glass interface will not get back into the fiber mode, provided that the cleave angle is sufficiently large.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use free-space optics for launching light from one fiber into the other.
Typical configurations contain a single <a href="lenses.html" title="transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> or two lenses.
An advantage of that approach is that the fiber ends can be kept at a safe distance, making it less likely to damage them.
Also, it is possible to efficiently couple light between fibers with different <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode areas</a> if the optics are designed accordingly.
Furthermore, it is possible to insert other optical elements, such as an <a href="optical_filters.html" title="devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectance">optical filter</a> or a <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolator</a>.
On the other hand, free-space optics have to be kept in stable alignment and are sensitive to dust.
In addition, losses arising from the <a href="fresnel_reflections.html" title="light reflections at optical interfaces">Fresnel reflections</a> at the fiber ends cannot be avoided.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Tolerances for Low-loss Fiber Joints</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Multimode Fibers</h3>
<div>
<p>The alignment tolerances for connections between fibers are relatively low for <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, particularly for those with a large <a href="fiber_core.html" title="the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> area.
A high coupling efficiency is possible if the parameters of the two fibers differ substantially.
It is sufficient that the second fiber (receiving the light) has values of the core diameter and <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> which are equal or higher than those of the first fiber.
If these parameters are higher for the second fiber, the light in that fiber will in general have nearly the same power but a lower <a href="brightness.html" title="a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: often used instead of radiance or luminance">brightness</a>, whereas a substantial coupling loss can occur for light coming from the second fiber.</p>
<p>If there is a transverse mismatch or an angular mismatch of the two fiber cores, this can lead to a coupling loss which may be estimated with geometrical considerations, if the light uniformly fills the whole core area and angular range.
Note that the coupling loss generally depends on how the <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> is distributed over the fiber <a href="modes.html" title="self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>.
For this and other reasons, reliably estimating coupling losses for multimode fibers is hard to achieve.</p>
<p>The wave nature of light can lead to surprising behavior in multimode fiber coupling.
For example, if the output fiber has a somewhat larger core than the input fiber and the same <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, one may expect to have zero coupling losses.
This is not the case, however, because the larger core changes the shapes of the mode profiles, so that the modes of the input fiber cannot fully be transformed into guided modes of the output fiber; some of the light gets into the cladding &ndash; but strongly depending on the considered mode of the input fiber, and often sensitively depending on the magnitude of core size mismatch (with complicated non-monotonic dependencies).
For such reasons, reliable estimations of coupling losses for multimode fibers require <a href="rp_fiber_calculator.html">numerical software</a>, not just some simple equations.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Single-mode Fibers</h3>
<div>
<p>The situation is rather different for coupling of single-mode fibers.
Here, the coupling loss can not depend on the direction of propagation.
It can be low only if the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<ul>
<li>The modal shapes and particularly the <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode areas</a> are similar.</li>
<li>The transverse and angular alignment of the modes is rather precise.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effects of a transverse offset <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&Delta;</span><i>x</i></span> and a mismatch of mode radii <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>2</sub></span> on the coupling efficiency can be calculated with the following formula:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/eta_wdx.gif" width="221" height="62" alt="coupling efficiency for single-mode fibers"></div>
<p>It is assumed that the mode fields can be well approximated by Gaussian functions.
The equation ignores possible effects from Fresnel reflections at the fiber ends, which is perfectly reasonable for <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splices</a>, for example.</p>

<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/eta_theta.gif" width="160" height="56" alt="coupling efficiency for single-mode fibers with angular misalignment"></div>
<p>This shows that the angular alignment becomes more critical for <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a>.</p>
<p>Note that for large angles, where the coupling loss becomes very large, the results become quite sensitive to the mode shape.
This means that the mentioned formula, which depends on the approximation of a Gaussian mode shape, may no longer produce accurate results.</p>
