<p>A beam profiler (<em>beam analyzer</em>, <em>mode profiler</em>) is a diagnostic device for <a href="laser_beam_characterization.html" title="methods of assessing detailed properties of laser beams">laser beam characterization</a> which can measure the whole <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a> profile of a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>, i.e., not only the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> but also the detailed shape.</p>
<p>Beam profilers are used in various ways; a qualitative impression of a beam profile can help during alignment of a laser, whereas measurements of the beam radius at different locations along the beam axis (the <em>caustic</em>) allow one to calculate the <a href="m2_factor.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a> or the <a href="beam_parameter_product.html" title="product of the beam radius in a focus and the far-field beam divergence">beam parameter product</a>, quantitatively characterizing the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.</p>

Intensity profiles of a Gaussian beam (left) and a multimode laser beam (right). The latter exhibits more complicated variations of the intensity. Such <a href="multimode_beams.html" title="light beams in free space or in transparent media which involve multiple (often many) modes, frequently with highly random characteristics">multimode beams</a> can be generated in <a href="lasers.html" title="devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> where the fundamental resonator modes are substantially smaller than the pumped region in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>.

<p>Beam quality monitoring with appropriate laser beam diagnostics can be important for many <a href="laser_applications.html" title="applications involving laser devices">laser applications</a> such as material processing; the quality of drilled holes, e.g., may be achieved more consistently if the beam quality is monitored.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Camera-based Beam Profilers</h2>
<div>
<p>Many beam profilers are based on some type of digitizing <a href="cameras.html" title="optical instruments for recording still or moving images">camera</a>.
For the visible and near-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region, CMOS and CCD cameras are the most common.
CMOS devices are less expensive, but CCDs generally have a better linearity and lower noise.
A resolution (given by the pixel size) of the order of 5&nbsp;&mu;m is possible with both CCDs and CMOS cameras, so that the beam radius may be as small as 50&nbsp;&mu;m or even less.
The active area may have dimensions up to several millimeters, so that very large beams can be handled.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:250px;">
<img src="img/beam_profiler.png" alt="camera-based laser beam profiler">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Different wavelength regions require different sensor types.
Silicon-based sensors are a good choice for wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared spectral region up to roughly 1 or 1.1&nbsp;&mu;m, whereas InGaAs-based detectors can be used up to &asymp;&thinsp;1.7&nbsp;&mu;m.
For still longer wavelengths, e.g. for the beam characterization of <a href="co2_lasers.html" title="infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules">CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</a>, <a href="pyroelectric_detectors.html" title="light detectors based on the pyroelectric effect">pyroelectric</a> and microbolometer <a href="infrared_cameras.html" title="cameras which work with infrared light">infrared cameras</a> are suitable.
These are fairly expensive.
Their comparatively low <a href="responsivity.html" title="photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> may not be a disadvantage, given the high output power of such lasers.
For <a href="ultraviolet_lasers.html" title="lasers (or other laser-based light sources) generating ultraviolet light">ultraviolet lasers</a>, CCD and CMOS arrays can be used in conjunction with UV conversion plates, converting the radiation to longer wavelengths which do not damage the arrays.</p>
<p>The spatial resolution of a camera sensor is an important quantity.
With silicon sensors, pixel sizes well below 10&nbsp;&mu;m are possible, allowing to measure beam diameters down to the order of 50&nbsp;&mu;m.
InGaAs detectors have substantially larger pixels with a width of e.g. 30&nbsp;&mu;m, whereas pyroelectric arrays don't get far below 100&nbsp;&mu;m.
The consequence of a low spatial resolution is that the beam sizes have to be kept large, which also leads to a long <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a>.
For that reason, more space is required for a complete <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> measurement.
The number of pixels is also of practical importance; a larger number allows one to measure beam diameters in a larger range.</p>
<p>When used with narrow-<a href="linewidth.html" title="width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> laser radiation, camera-based systems are particularly sensitive to artifacts caused by the high temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>.
A careful optical design (without windows, causing parasitic reflections) is required for suppressing such artifacts and/or for eliminating their effects on the measured data.</p>
<p>Most cameras are very light sensitive &ndash; often much more than required.
The laser beam then has to be attenuated (see below) before hitting the camera.
Some <a href="imaging.html" title="mapping objects points to image points; applications involving such methods">imaging</a> optics (e.g. <a href="beam_expanders.html" title="optical devices for modifying the beam radius of a collimated beam">beam expanders</a> or beam reducers for expanding the range of allowed beam radii) may also be used, so that the camera records a beam profile as it occurs at some other location (the imaged plane).
This also allows good shielding against ambient light.
However, the optics should not, of course, introduce excessive <a href="optical_aberrations.html" title="degradations of optical images caused in imaging instruments">optical aberrations</a>.</p>
<p>The recorded beam profile may be displayed on a computer screen, possibly together with measured parameters such as <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a>, beam position, ellipticity, and statistical information, or Gaussian fits.
The software may allow to select between different methods of determining the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a>, such as the D4&sigma; method or a simple 1/e<sup>2</sup> criterion.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Scanning Beam Profilers Based on Slits, Knife Edges, or Pinholes</h2>
<div>
<p>There are also beam profilers which scan a beam profile with one or several <a href="pinholes.html" title="circular holes, typically with diameters well below one millimeter">pinholes</a>, with a <a href="optical_slits.html" title="narrow openings through which light can be transmitted">slit</a>, or with a knife edge.
In any case, some structured mechanical part (which is often fixed on a rotating part) is quickly moved through the beam, while the transmitted power is recorded with a <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> and some electronics.
A computer (a PC or a built-in microprocessor) is used to reconstruct the beam profile from the measured data and to display it on a screen.
For example, the transmitted power versus position of a knife edge may essentially be differentiated in order to obtain a one-dimensional intensity profile of the beam, whereas a moving slit directly provides the intensity profile.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:369px;">
<img src="img/nanoscan2.jpg" alt="scanning slit profiler">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span>

The PC screen displays the obtained scans in two directions as well as the reconstructed beam profile.

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The spatial resolution of scanning systems can be as high as a few micrometers, or even close to a single micrometer (particularly for scanning pinholes or slits), suitable for the characterization of small-diameter beams.
An important advantage of the concept of scanning is that the <a href="photodetectors.html" title="devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> used does not need to have a spatial resolution, so that detectors for very different wavelength regions can easily be used.
Also, it is easier to obtain a large dynamic range, compared with, e.g., a camera.
The powers which can be handled may range from microwatts to watts.
Beam attenuation before the detector is easily achieved, because the required optical quality is much lower than that for a camera system.</p>
<p>Scanning beam profilers, particularly those based on a slit or a knife edge, are most suitable for beam profiles which are not too far from <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian</a>, because the recorded signal is usually integrated in one spatial direction, so that the reconstruction of complicated (more structured) beam shapes is not perfect.</p>
<p>Some scanning beam profilers can also be used for pulsed laser beams such as those from <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>.
However, this works only for high enough pulse repetition rates; note that the minimum repetition rate may depend on the beam diameter.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Important Issues to Observe</h2>
<div>
<p>Various requirements need to be assessed when selecting a beam profiler for a particular application:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the range of beam radii or diameters to be measured? What is the required accuracy? What definition of <a href="beam_radius.html" title="a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> should be used?</li>
<li>Are the considered beams close to <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian</a>, or do they have complicated shapes, such as occur, e.g., in the output of <a href="diode_bars.html" title="a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a>?</li>
<li>What is the range of <a href="optical_power.html" title="the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> (often depending on the beam radius)? Is a device with a large dynamic range required, or is it acceptable to work in a narrow range of optical powers? Will an adjustable <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam">attenuator</a> be needed?</li>
<li>Is it most convenient to have a device connected to a PC (or a laptop computer), e.g. via an USB 2.0 cable, or should the device have its own electronics for displaying the results?</li>
<li>What software features are required? For example, which beam parameters need to be displayed directly? Should the device be able to measure beam parameters reliably in a wide range of beam radii and powers? Are data logging features required?</li>
<li>Is it necessary that the device can handle beams with temporally varying power, e.g. from Q-switched lasers?</li>
<li>For complete beam quality characterization: should the device automatically record beam profiles at different locations and calculate the <a href="m2_factor.html" title="a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a>?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Beam Attenuation</h2>
<div>
<p>In many cases &ndash; particularly for camera-based systems &ndash;, it is necessary first to attenuate the power of a laser beam before sending it into the beam profiler.
Some systems use an <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam">optical attenuator</a> (e.g. a wedged neutral-density filter) in transmission; the weak reflection e.g. from a high-quality glass plate may also be utilized.</p>
<p>Although attenuation may appear as a trivial task, inappropriate methods can cause a number of problems.
Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some <a href="optical_attenuators.html" title="devices which can reduce the optical power e.g. of a light beam">attenuators</a> do not have good optical quality, or can spoil the beam quality of narrow-linewidth beams through <a href="interference.html" title="a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effects based on reflections from surfaces.</li>
<li>Particularly absorbing filters can spoil the beam quality at high power levels, where thermal effects occur.</li>
<li>It is not advisable to use the low residual transmission of a highly reflecting <a href="dielectric_mirrors.html" title="mirrors consisting of multiple thin layers of different transparent optical materials">dielectric mirror</a> for beam quality measurements, since the residual <a href="transmissivity.html" title="the ratio of transmitted optical power to the incident optical power at a surface">transmissivity</a> can depend strongly on the position on the mirror.</li>
<li>A weak reflection from of an optical surface operated with p polarization near <a href="brewsters_angle.html" title="an angle of incidence at which there is no reflection of p-polarized light at an uncoated optical surface">Brewster's angle</a> is often not suitable, since such an operation point has a much higher reflectivity for s polarization and may therefore only show the pattern of <a href="depolarization_loss.html" title="losses of optical power in a laser resonator, caused by depolarization e.g. in a laser crystal">depolarization</a> in the laser gain medium rather than the actual beam quality.</li>
<li>As some methods provide attenuation only in coarse and not adjustable steps, it may be difficult to reach the optimum power level in the detector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aspects of convenience may also matter.
For example, it is helpful if the electronics can automatically adjust the required attenuation factor.</p>

Furthermore, the calculations done by the software are ISO-compliant and give the user the most accurate beam characterization available, all this in a lightweight environment that doesn’t take days to fully master.</p></aside>
