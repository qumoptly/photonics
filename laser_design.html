<h2>Help on Laser Designs</h2>
<p>Well working laser designs need to be based on a thorough theoretical understanding of laser physics and on various calculations.
For example, resonator designs for bulk lasers should be checked and possibly optimized in terms of alignment sensitivity.
RP Photonics offers competent help in this area as well as powerful simulation <a href="software.html">software</a>.</p>

<p>The term <em>design</em> can have two different meanings.
In some cases, it is meant to be a detailed description of a device, including e.g. used parts, how they are put together, and important operation parameters.
In other cases, the term denotes the process leading to such a description.
This article discusses some important aspects for the design of laser devices, such as <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>, or similar devices such as <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillators</a>.
A separate article on <a href="laser_development.html" title="the process of developing a laser device">laser development</a> gives additional information.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Defining the Design Goals</h2>
<div>
<p>Before a design is made, the <em>design goals</em> must be carefully evaluated.
These should include not only the central performance parameters such as output power and wavelength; many more details can be relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimum performance, e.g. in terms of output power, <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">power efficiency</a>, <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, <a href="brightness.html" title="a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: often used instead of radiance or luminance">brightness</a>, <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity</a> and/or <a href="phase_noise.html" title="noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a>, long-term stability (e.g. of the output power or the <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>), <a href="timing_jitter.html" title="fluctuations of the temporal positions of pulses">timing jitter</a>, etc.</li>
<li>compact and convenient setup, ease of operation (e.g. simple turn-on procedure, simple <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tuning</a>, no need for realignment)</li>
<li>maximum flexibility (e.g. for changing operation parameters)</li>
<li>reliability, low maintenance requirements, simple and cost-effective error analysis, maintenance and repair</li>
<li>minimum sensitivity to vibrations, temperature changes, electromagnetic interference, aging of components</li>
<li>low production cost, i.e., a small number of parts, simple <a href="alignment_sensitivity_of_optical_resonators.html" title="the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">alignment</a> and testing, avoiding the use of parts which are expensive, sensitive, or difficult to obtain</li>
</ul>
<aside class="textbox tb_right greenmargin" style=" width:250px;">
<h2>In Short</h2>
<p>Details of the design of a laser product can have a strong impact on its performance, reliability, flexibility, and manufacturing cost.
For an efficient development process, it is essential</p>
<ul>
<li>to be aware of all the design goals,</li>
<li class="ta_left">to know the design properties required for reaching them,</li>
<li class="ta_left">and to use a proper laser design (which is worked out at the beginning)</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p>It is certainly advisable to work out carefully the list of these requirements for the particular case before investing any significant resources in <a href="laser_development.html" title="the process of developing a laser device">laser development</a>, because it can easily be much more expensive and time-consuming to introduce additional properties into an already existing device.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Important Aspects of Laser Designs</h2>
<div>
<p>The properties of the designed laser device are largely determined by the design details, not only by the parts used.
Some aspects are particularly important:</p>
<ul>
<li>general design parameters, such as <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> length (influencing compactness, <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">tuning</a> issues, frequency stability, etc.), pump intensity</li>
<li>selection of <a href="gain_media.html" title="media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> (e.g. a <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>) and pump source, suitable choice of geometry (e.g. rod or <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin disk</a>, <a href="side_pumping.html" title="a technique of pumping a solid-state laser in directions which are approximately transverse to its beam direction">side pumping</a> or <a href="end_pumping.html" title="a technique of optically pumping a laser medium in a direction along the laser beam">end pumping</a>), <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a>, crystal length, etc.</li>
<li>pump setup (e.g. for <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped lasers</a>), influencing output power and <a href="beam_quality.html" title="a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, long-term stability, and the ease of exchanging pump diodes</li>
<li>optimum type of <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> (e.g. as linear or <a href="ring_lasers.html" title="lasers with a ring resonator">ring laser</a>, with monolithic or with discrete elements) and optimized <a href="resonator_design.html" title="the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a>, influencing aspects such as the number of parts, the output power and beam quality, <a href="alignment_sensitivity_of_optical_resonators.html" title="the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">alignment tolerances</a>, sensitivity to <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, mechanical stability and drifts</li>
<li>selection and placement of <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a> and intracavity components for <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tuning</a>, generation of short <a href="pulses.html" title="flashes of light">pulses</a> via <a href="mode_locking.html" title="a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode locking</a>, <a href="dispersion_compensation.html" title="the control of the overall chromatic dispersion of a system by adding optical elements with a suitable amount of dispersion">dispersion compensation</a>, frequency stabilization, etc.</li>
<li>mechanical housing, influencing mechanical stability, efficiency of <a href="laser_cooling_units.html" title="devices used for cooling of high-power lasers">cooling</a>, temperature drifts, ease of maintenance, and <a href="laser_safety.html" title="safety of the use of laser devices">safety issues</a></li>
<li>electronic equipment, e.g. for <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">stabilizing the output power</a>, controlling the laser wavelength, monitoring the status of pump diodes or temperatures, ensuring <a href="laser_safety.html" title="safety of the use of laser devices">safe operation</a></li>
<li>proper documentation, including a part list (possibly with suppliers), mechanical designs, alignment and testing procedures, design ideas, possibly optional extensions and limitations for modifying operation parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>This list, which is certainly not yet complete, shows that proper laser designs are not a trivial matter, but are essential for achieving full customer satisfaction, cost efficiency, and flexibility for future developments.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">What is Needed for Designing Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>Designing a laser is a challenging task.
The following are definitely required:</p>
<ul>
<li>a detailed understanding of the requirements, which may include some understanding of the application</li>
<li>a detailed understanding of all the relevant physical effects, such as laser amplification, <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a>, <a href="laser_noise.html" title="fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a>, etc., and their interaction</li>
<li>the essential data, e.g. of <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a></li>
<li>the ability to reduce the complexity to a practical level without losing important details</li>
<li>flexible <a href="software.html">software</a> for calculations and simulations</li>
<li>practical experience with lasers, enabling one to recognize typical problems, correctly interpret experimental observations, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that software alone is by no means sufficient to work out good laser designs.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Role of a Design in a Development Project</h2>
<div>
<p>It is common practice, but nevertheless generally not advisable, to consider a laser design as a result of a <a href="laser_development.html" title="the process of developing a laser device">development</a> process which is largely based on trial and error.
The design then plays a minor role, just summarizing the results of a lengthy process.
In such cases, the design is often not even properly documented, which creates a risk of losing a lot of potentially valuable information while saving only a minor amount of time at the moment.</p>
<p>In any non-trivial design project &ndash; and laser design projects are hardly ever trivial &ndash; it is very advisable to attribute a vital role to the laser design:</p>
<ul>
<li>The laser design <em>is made in the office</em>, not in the laboratory, and properly deals with all known issues which can be or become relevant.
Although this process can be much faster and cheaper than a trial-and-error approach in the lab, it takes some considerable discipline and of course requires a comprehensive expertise.</li>
<li>A proper design is not just a set of ideas, but a very specific description, including e.g. the list of required parts, a more or less detailed prescription on how to put them together wherever this is not trivial, and is ideally supplemented by a description of the underlying reasoning, a discussion of limitations, etc.</li>
<li>The prototype is then fabricated according to the design, and not vice versa.
This greatly speeds up the fabrication, thus making efficient use of costly laboratory resources.</li>
<li>For any future development of similar kind, the carefully worked out design will be a very valuable input.
If it does not exist, and particularly if in addition a vital person has left the company, future developments will be much less efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attempts to abbreviate this process carry the risk of obtaining reduced performance values and of large time delays due to unexpected technical problems.
The later such problems are recognized, understood and solved, the larger can be the resulting damage.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Deriving Designs from Older Designs</h2>
<div>
<p>In industrial development, it is common to derive some product design from an older design, rather than starting from scratch.
Although this appears very economical, there are significant risks, particularly in cases where the first design has not be properly worked out and documented in a process as described above.
A central challenge is that modifying some detail of a laser design may easily have unexpected side effects, introducing new problems which then require additional measures, which again can have side effects.</p>
<p>For such reasons, starting with some initial design, which works e.g. with some lower than desired output power, can be helpful, but it still requires a detailed understanding of that design and its limitations.
A proper design document for the initial design can make it easy to produce a whole family of designs, which differ in e.g. output power or pulse repetition rate.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Design Reviews</h2>
<div>
<p>Under certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to make a review of an existing laser design.
This can be the case, for example, when significant problems have occurred, or when the demands have increased and might be met with a revised design, rather than with a completely new one.
If a properly documented design does not yet exist, it is high time to do this job; this process may already deliver important hints concerning what to improve.</p>
